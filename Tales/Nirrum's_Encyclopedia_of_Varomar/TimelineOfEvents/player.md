Created Wednesday 10 April 2019
</p>

<p>
<b>Year 0</b><br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
The Mana people emerge on the desolate shores of the Dragon Coast, and found the City of Tepet, where they are first able to make contact with Pelor through a powerful cleric of his. Pelor is the first god to walk the newly created plane and locates the creators that remain. He speaks with the great white tree and using its roots as anchors, spreads great wilds and vegetation for the population to harvest and farm. He calls Melora to do the same for the sea, and she does, filling it with a great many animals. 
</div>
</p>

<p>
Year 1 Mielikki and Silvanus of the forgotten realms find the plane through twin clerics. They make the wilderness truly wild, and fill it with its own life. One Might argue that they corrupt the works of Melora and Pelor, but let's be honest, this plane is about to go tits up.
</p>

<p>
Year 2 Orcus Follows Mielikki and Assaults the plane. This begins the first Cataclysm, which sinks half of the only part of the plane that was dry land , cracking it from west to east. Tepet is submerged entirely. magma leaks from the sea of fire that makes a shield around Teruna's Physical prison, The remainder of dry land is almost entirely scorched, The Great Tree's roots are cut on those lines. Tepet is saved by her will, forming a great shield of wood against the waves. 
</p>

<p>
Year 50, Reluctantly, Nek Uiji Beseeches Pelor to help, the plane is breaking, the prison now has cracks, and The Great Tree is losing strength. Pelor calls upon the Raven Queen. 
</p>

<p>
Year 51. The first winter comes. Cold Arrives and Death itself inches closer to Teruna's Bound form. The Raven Queen lands, Cools the fires spewing from the Great chasm and traps orcus in a lake of ice which she buries deep underground, plugging the largest of the cracks of the plane with Orcus' own body and using his power to hold Teruna harder still. She forms a great city where she keeps watch over her most hated enemies. It is called "The Inferno." She takes up residence on the plane to subdue Orcus for as long as she can. This is not so hard for her, while she abhors the undead, her and orcus both prefer quiet, and the arrangement of his prison and her domain lends well to that stillness. Orcus does not try hard to leave so often
</p>

<p>
64 The Creature Allabar, opener of the way, is chased into orbit around the prison planes by Hirokira, the Devouring inferno. Through the meddling of great mages across the prison planes, they are fit into a stable orbit that composes a standard year and enables a regular seasonal cycle as well as predictable tides. Through this cycle, we retroactively measured the timeline
</p>

<br>

<p>
Year 121, the Waters fully subside. The Continent is pushed back together and the wilds partially restored. The aegis mountains now stand tall where the chasm once leaked the Plane's Fiery blood. The City of Tepet  has built its own dungeon, The hall of Dramuut (A collection of mushed words, appropriated concepts (de/ra/mu/oo/utar) which just radiates unwillingness to answer), containing Elder Dramuut, the sandstone titan. The Roots recede back into theground
</p>

<p>
Year 128, Dwarves first appear on the plane and immediately begin colonizing the Aegis moutains. They fight back the volcano and in the process, free up many of the tunnels that had filled with unbearable heat and toxic gases, life in those regions of the underdark begins to flourish again. 
</p>

<p>
Year 204, First contact is made between the Lelumadil Dwarves and the Early Manarahi. The Manarahi get their name from their great prowess in crafting spells. The Magic People. They take a great liking to this name and foster an immediate bond with the Lelumadil, trading supplies for magic.  
</p>

<p>
Year 205, Datan doorswords is Captured from the Skal Settlement by ogres, during this time she drinks a potion of longevity which she had mistakenly bought instead of a healing potion
</p>

<p>
Year 256, Skalmirthon is founded as a city, Contact is made with the underdark. First the Drow, then the svirfneblin, then other, Rarer races.  
</p>

<p>
Year 512, the Manarahi move northward from tepet to Mana Ulla, one of the Leyline nodes that crisscross the plane, channeling denser flows of Mana through the land toward areas of higher or lower magical density. Datan Doorswords, one of the lelumadil dwarves, is captured from the ogres by goblins
</p>

<p>
Year 782 , Cermina, or Cher-Mina, depending on your dialect, is founded as a drow city near what will soon become the beginning of Konia. 
</p>

<p>
Year 829, a few other gods from multiple pantheons travel to see this plane, so far outside their normal influence. Their own worlds suffer from their absence, few leave blessings behind
</p>

<p>
1024 - The Hobgoblin empire of the Sunstorm crown sets up in the middle of the ushlubarel basin
</p>

<p>
1085 - The hobgoblins are at full war with the skalmirthon dwarves
</p>

<p>
1117 - The Barretts and the Burkes usurp the O'morans, taking over their castle in Balina with the help of  Gerald Fitzwalter, Whose father was then Castellan of Windsor castle, Walter Fitzotho de Windsor.
</p>

<p>
1176 - The sunstorm crown is defeated and their civilization erased.  A dwarven outpost is set up where their capital was 
</p>

<p>
1212 - The dwarven outpost falls to draconic necromancers, after which a beholder named Baxhaltuuth occupies the structure in the same year
</p>

<p>
1281 - The tribes of Dragonborn that would make up Danzuishan emerge in the middle of the Gannaga River. War ensues among them. Their fragmented people only becoming one once more in 2663
</p>

<p>
1451 - The Manarahi and the lemumadil go to war, it is a short war over a trade dispute and ends in dragonfire, many such conflicts remain undocumented as their origins are unimportant when compared to their endings, they are often stark reminders of how cruel this world can be.
</p>

<p>
1573 - Datan doorswords, Queen of the goblins, is taken hostage by Kobolds
</p>

<p>
1600 - A path to the feywild finally grows onto the plane, the fey infuse the world with new magics, bolstering its health, Many of the Archfey that stick around the plane are tired of their courtly duties and see this as a reprieve, the Prison's own energy builds new additions to the fey lands around
</p>

<p>
1601 - The shadowfell responds in kind.  Paths to both are now present on the plane, though interworld travel is still nearly impossible due to the sheer distance, (magical and physical) that the prison planes are from just about everything else.
</p>

<p>
1650-1900  this 250 year span is marked by a continuous presence of faulty modrons and no one has been able to determine the source of to this day. This is the dominant event for the time period and if an adventurer were to find large mechanical pieces where they should not be, it was probably because of this, 
</p>

<p>
Year 1972 - Kemalabet Brucheva is born Komi Milat. In twenty years she will become the ruler of the Manarahi and then sink deep into necromancy, transforming into a lich and leaving a power vacuum in Mana Ulla
</p>

<p>
Year 1988, Another settlement, humans mostly, erupts on the west coast. This would eventually become the Center of Konia
</p>

<p>
Year 1990, Just after the new year, a shining golden human is born among the Manarahi and within seconds, disappears with a hint of planar shenanigans. 
</p>

<p>
Year 1992, Kemalabet Brucheva transforms into a lich and is responsible for the purportedly accidental deaths of her family and upper court, this marks the beginning of the end for Mana Ulla
</p>

<p>
Year 2024, The beginning of instabilities for the Manarahi on the Mana Ulla leyline node is marked with the death of twelve people at a dinner party to a fart joke gone wrong.
</p>

<p>
2033, The Leyline instability begins wreaking havoc on the Manarahi, and people begin leaving, following the pilgrim path of the Omshahi, Aescetic monks who venerated the world as it was, and by extension, Sylvanus. These people would travel across Kavir-e Namak northward for weeks before reaching Mohara, an only slightly more forgiving clime than the salty desert. Their encampment around a single small spring, a few deep caves would eventually become Manaharamu. With the great grass road not so far off, food could be found, but Manaharamu's legacy, and indeed the legacy of the magic people will always be their Magic.<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<i>Nirrum's Note: By all research, Pelor was here first, and sylvanus is about as artificial  as the Artificery. The Omshahi won't listen to reason though. Cowards.</i>
</div>
</p>

<br>

<p>
2048- Datan Doorswords the roar of dragons, is captured by Devils
</p>

<p>
2053 - She-Of-Iron-Nests is born a yellowjacket wasp, and a month into her life is awakened by a vindictive wizard hoping to annoy a rival. Within 20 years, the hive reaches the equivalent of a 9th level Wizard and leaves Mana Ulla for Skalmirthon, the most likely place for her to come across materials to sustain her colony's intelligence. She has since become one of the most powerful mages on the plane and an excellent co-worker. Happy Birthday S.O.I.N!<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<b>Note of The Nest Queen:</b><i>Thank you Nirrum, I have left a book on Recursive ritual casting on your desk</i>
</div>
</p>

<p>
2081- Aralc the Archfey of Eyes, in a fit of compassion, forced the last tenacious residents of Mana Ulla out of the city via teleport just before a great magical cataclysm wiped out all life in the area. It is theorized that this Leyline instability had something to do with the Konian establishment of their own country, but this seems to be racism from historians who can't really do their job,<sub>Looking at you Kaluubi.. </sub>The last manarahi begin their move northward, disdaining their brethren as quitters, cowards, and soft. The Kholirahi, not much different from other rambunctious hill folk, are born, declaring their exodus poetic and ironic, hating their own lack of strength that they had despised in the other Manarahi. Their tales still say they will return to drink the waters of Mana Ulla once they are strong enough. 
</p>

<p>
2101 - Another human civilization pops up on the ganglegrove peninsula. It's name "Font" simply refers to the fact that they built in a swamp (Cognate "fountain" in common). The abundant food and game in ganglegrove ensures their base survival at least. Metrizin Furi makes contact with the Skalmirthon dwarves, seeking refuge, the Furi Family will remain here for quite some time
</p>

<p>
2125 - <b>Manaharamu is founded officially and is declared the new home of the Manarahi, who name themselves the Manahararahi, the magic ountain people</b>
</p>

<p>
2141- Kao 'Ni, Kao 'Na. The announcement from the first king of their contact with the humans to the north east, He cannot bargain with them. The settlers on Mohara do not get a warm welcome from their northern neighbours who lay seige on them. It is only from the last blessing of Kemalabet Brucheva, the Lich-Bard-Princess of Mana Ulla one of the most advanced necromancers to ever exist, that they survive as she descends upon the army who have taken quite a liking to the name "Konia." Her wrath was expressed as a litany of Evil Fey who abscond with many of the Konians in the middle of the night during the second day of seige. Darklings mostly, whose actions spawn meenlock, who spawn redcaps, who spawn boggles. The Konian historians would view this as Manaharamu's Connection to dark powers. The Kholirahi, later, would observe this event as a sign of the true nature of the Manarahi, poetic, and propaganda would see Kemalabet heralded as the Matron Saint of the Kholirahi, despite being the *first* to leave Mana Ulla. Her power is seen as an example of the lengths that the Manarahi <i>should </i> go through to get power over others. Her mercy on her own people, while reserved, would be seen as the founding example for the first God-king
</p>

<p>
2222 - After 80 years of tension, Manaharamu opens a retaliatory strike against konia, war begins anew
</p>

<p>
2230 - Peace talks occur and finally succeed, the two nations remain at peace for quite some time. 
</p>

<p>
2299 - The Kholirahi settle in the ushlubarel
</p>

<p>
2367 - Konia begins to build its inner walls and claims them as a defense against the monsters outside them
</p>

<p>
2368 - <b>The university of Manaharamu is founded on the longest day of the year by the first Archmage, Kilikara Campani, A half-orc from Konia who came to Manaharamu to learn their magic. When she could not find a teacher, she built a house to teach what she knew and spent all of her earnings collecting more and more advanced magical equipment. All who would come to what was then a building smaller than even the entrance hall, would offer respects, but worked under the conditon that Kilikara would watch them. From watching, She became a wizard of the 17th level, focusing on transmutation. She spent a large portion of her time making the university bigger. While Celebrated, she was killed in a wizards duel by an elf named Fenil Morowal. Fenil would become the second archmage and establish the tradition of succession in the university's various departments.</b>
</p>

<p>
2492 - The year of darkness. A  stain on the history of varomar. An offshore earthquake releases millions of monsters into the oceans. Many make their way ashore, foul things of the abyss, of limbo, of the far realm and of what lies behind the dreary grey of the shadowfell. This year and the decade thereafter is a time where all races band together to fight against the foulness that is part of our home. Orcs stand alongside elves, humans, halflings, and others with the blessing of gruumsh, Kill or be killed. The tenure of such creatures has never really been full erased from the surface, but by the strength of our spirits they were certainly diminished. It is not even two months after the event in the south when all nations are engulfed in the struggle, including those in the north 
</p>

<p>
2493 - The Kholirahi's Ushlubarel settlement is overrun and thousands die to nightmarish hunters. They move northward again and make a stand on the southside of the Ualakomara north east of what is now Varshelm
