Bizzarely Situtational Magic inscriptions


Knørra - This rune can be inscribed on any item. The item reflects twice the Light that hits it unless that light was already reflected by an item marked with a Knørra rune. If the item does damage while it is in bright light, it does radiant damage instead.
