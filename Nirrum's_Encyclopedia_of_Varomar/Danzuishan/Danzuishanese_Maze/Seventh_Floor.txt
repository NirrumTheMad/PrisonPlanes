====== Seventh Floor - Grain ======
Created Friday 03 September 2021


The party awakens in a wide field of wheat, all wilting, unpetrified, and refreshed. When the party stands, the wheat stands tall, about 5ft. The room is proportionately narrow, being 200ft wide and 1 mile long There are twelve doors out of the room, Door one is near the party and in the middle of the short wall
* if the party cuts the wheat, the entire field of wheat begins to whip and writhe as the wheat cuts itself down, leaving only dead stalks and one remaining stalk that attempts to tie itself in a knot and kill itself. The party can see the entire room now
* If the party tries to walk through the wheat without cutting it, the wheat parts itself, leaving a relative uninhibiting path to Door 1. 
	* If the party tries to walk through the wheat anyway, the wheat forms a circle around the party as they walk, bending down and then springing back up after they pass
* If the party takes a wheatberry from any plant, the field goes completely still
	* Attempting to eat the wheatberry causes all of the plants to begin attacking eachother until the room is only filled with flour and chaff
	* Planting the wheatberry makes the entire feild of wheat into nonmagical wheat but anyone who does so gains the charm of nine lives when they leave the room
* If the party attempts to talk to the wheat, they only hear an echo of their own thoughts
* If the party casts plant growth on the wheat, the wheat grows to gargantuan sizes immediately. Maintaining the plant growth for the full duration  causes a single wheatberry to fall near the caster, inside is a Lohar of the witch lords

**Door 1**
Door 1 is a small door stylized with the carved image of an oak, and it heads to a room that seems to be made of walnut wood, though attempting to damage the wood reveals that it is just veneer. The domed interior is lit by a large but short ring of green fire. The Fire surrounds a screeching woman in black clothing. She is blind, and cannot see anything though seems to genuinely attempt to respond to sound. When someone steps fully into the ring of fire, her skin sheds, revealing a single giant ant. Defeating the ant causes it to convulse and lay an egg that contains a human baby. The baby is immune to acid and resistant to cold, but is otherwise nonmagical and doesn't appear to have anything that would turn it into a later ant.  

**Door 2**
	This door is the second closest to the players, and is made of solid iron. Opening the door turns the gravity of the main room sideways, toward the open door. and inside it is a single pinecone made of steel at the bottom of a bowl-like depression made of crosshatched iron. If planted, an otherwise normal pine grows (at a normal rate, years to become noticeable) that is made entirely of 1045 steel, though resistant to corrosion. 
	
**Door 3 **
	This room contains a corridor that leads through a mansion, within which there is no colour, and vision is obscured by strange flecks in the light.  A vampire, a werewolf, a fish-like person, and a meat golem, all of which have half their normal movement speed all live in the house. The party enters on the third floor, on which the vampire lives. All members of the house are sapient and capable of leaving the maze.
	* The Mustachioied vampire has no reason to leave the maze and will plot to drain the blood of the party members as they sleep. The other members of the house will be disappointed at the Vampire's death, as they are known to be an excellent comedian, but also definitely bloodthirsty. If the vampire cannot feed on the party or if the party is able to provide a source of fresh, innocent blood, the vampire becomes an excellent host, if not distant and spooky. The Vampire's lair contains many old books, All of which are about himself, who he Identifies as "Jonathan Harker"
	* The werewolf lives on the second floor, a human named Gareth Nobson, and while Gareth himself is petty, a liar, and the source of the destruction around the house, when he transforms at night, he becomes extremely honest and leaves through the main door of the house to "hunt witches and demons". He will, in his werewolf state kill any member of the party that is a pact of the fiend warlock. The Vampire and Fish person will both mourne the passing of the werewolf, though the meat Golem will make a comment  on their lack of character being tempered only by their curse. 
		* **On the second floor, the panels are adorned with images of fish. One of them is the image of a loach, and if splashed with vinegar or salt, Reveals a broom closet in which there is a pile of **
			* 38,000  Gold Pieces	
			* 500 Gold Pieces worth of silver spoons
			* One goblin skeleton in a stained maid's outfit
			* A freshly baked loaf of bread, steaming hot and quite delicious, inside of which is a silver whistle
	* The meat Golem lives on the first floor which is fantastically neat and tidy, and is set up to facilitate access to the front door and dissuade access to the other parts of this floor. The Golem is rather handsome, other than their glowing yellow eyes  and sitched together face, and is quite talkative and friendly for anyone who doesn't try to kill him. He offers therapy for members of the party who have issues with a difficult or villanous parent. For Creatures that have goals such as creating life from the dead, raising monstrosities, or taming as many beasts as possible, the golem is contemptuous and criticises them for their hubris that clouds their understanding of the responsibility that comes with their goals. The Golem does not give his name, but there is a family crest above a mantlepiece in his private library that reads "Frankenstein". The Golem is unused to affection and stays in this house for its tolerable roommates. If the meat Golem dies, every other member of the house becomes actively hostile. 
	* The Fish person lives in the flooded basement and will attack and grab any creature that comes near. His lair is filled with rusted weapons, though among the rust is a very shiny Lakewaker, which, when picked up, reveals a giant shark in the next room. The Giant shark is resting but wil attack if a party moves toward it. A successful Challenge 14 look for clues check will also reveal 400 Gold Pieces in scattered gold and silver, and if the check exceeds Challenge 17, one can also find a magical crystal of unusual properties. The other members of the house do not mourne the loss of the fish-like person. If the fish-like person is left alive, she can be pacified with any amount of meat weighing more than a pound, particularly humanoid meat, and will go about her business  tending to her shark and ignore the party if she is fed. If she is somehow exticated from the maze, she will take up residence in the northern gannaga, breeding sharks for the rest of her life.
	* The Front Door and all of the windows lead out to the **Eigth floor, the Forest room and upon exiting, the colour returns and flecks cease**


Door 4
	On the other side of the wheat field from Door 3 and slightly further away from door 1 is a 10ft tall, 20 inch-wide door. Most medium creatures can, with effort, squeeze though, though those over 6ft or 200lbs or those using plate or breastplate as armour are unable to fit unless they are strangely lanky or if they take off the armour and dismantle it.  The room is made of linen, dyed salmon pink, but it is unlit. Exposure to a torch will tarnish the fabric, and it can be set alight, but magical fire does not affect it.  The room  contains a single loom. Around the loom are parts of a spinning wheel a ripped up set of instructions for assembly, and A single old tooth that belonged to something roughly humanoid with a bloodsplatter nearby.
		* If the party fixes the spinning wheel (an intelligent check, Challenge 14, with an automatic success for someone with Weaver's Tools Proficiency), it immediately begins spinning, pulling fibre from seemingly nowhere. The loom begins to work again and the room begins to extend as reams of fabric are pushed from the autonomous loom. After an hour, the loom shudders and the spinning wheel flies apart and the room begins to shrink. This cycle repeats 13 times the room getting longer and longer, until on the final time, the loom weaves an opening into  **The Eigth floor, The river room. The Spinning wheel gets drawn into the loom by the last length of thread it produces, and both machines begin to rapidly fold at invisible hinges** until they have reduced themselves to a single, tiny spool of thread with a small arm. The thread is intensely magical, and glows in the presence of anyone connected to the fey. The spindle is inscribed in fey script with the words "Come undone ye thread, and do my bidding", which are the command words to return it to a Spinning wheel and loom.
		* If the party destroys the loom, the room begins to unravel, and each person who damaged the loom owes a favour to an Archfey
		* If the party uses some other fibre on the loom, It invariably produces a cloak of many fashions, regardless of the pattern the party uses
		* If the party puts some other nonfibrous material into the loom and attempts to work it manually, The loom siezes up.

Door 5
	Up the same wall from door 3, A hollow in the wall is covered by hanging vines. Passing through the vines converts a person's body and gear into pure fire and plasma, rendering one blind and deaf, and replacing these senses with blindsight 30. The person experiencing this realizes they are floating in space and around them are small orb-like rocks which float to orbit them. 
		* any person who allows the orbs to float around them gains the ability to hear the thoughts of the creatures living on the orbs, and are capable of granting them miracle powers and cleric or paladin status, which function as if this room is the entirety of the cosmos. The creatures live exceptionally fast lives and die before one can even think on them, though the orbited creature is able to communicate telepathically such that their will hangs around the creatures for most of their lives. If the will of the creature leads to the benefit and proliferation of life on that rock, the worship of the creature enhances, and they begin to gain magic to produce an afterlife and angels. Though the creatures on all such worlds are prone to power-seeking, war, and tribalism, so it is a difficult challenge (History (Intelligence) Challenge 20). Any creature that makes it to the next room with a healthy population of creatures still alive becomes permanently covered in thin lines of markings that, while microscopic, bear the likenesses of the creatures they fostered. Good and neutral aligned gods that come into direct contact with the creature in the future will recognize the marks as signs of godhood, though the scope of power granted by them is so incredibly tiny that they are functionally cosmetic. Most gods will view these marks favourably and can teach a player how to control the location and form of these markings. 
		* Any person who disrupts the orbs Finds that an identical and indistinguishable version of themselves appears before them to fight them to the death. If the person is a player, they are told to roll initiative twice and fight themselves. The winner is indistinguishable from the original upon leaving the room.
		* Any Person who fails to keep a population alive gains and loses nothing
	At the end of this room is aN INCOMPLETE SENTENCE
