===== Description =====
Where there is treasure to find, there are often people to find it. When the plane was cracked in the cataclysm and again washed by the waves of the year of darkness, sediment from the deep ocean was washed over the top layer of the prison. It hardened under its own weight, the weight of ash from the cataclysm, and then eroded in deep channels from the tsunamis that crashed into the land. Rain and time have done their part carving deep into the heart of the new rock, exposing some of the little metamorphic rock to be found on this plane at all. Here, after a long journey out of the prison and away from the bottom of the aegis, the Lakoshti decided to settle. Predominantly the lakoshti are minotaurs with some Orcish families (of the same tribe as broomb's band). Here they found gold and lapis, water, trade, salt and rare foods

===== Urban =====
Lakosti is built in a triangle following the carved basin of the river Anapasi as it flows out of the badlands toward the sea of Endless rain. The Countryside is largely dry other than the benefaction of the anapasi as it delivers what little water falls in the badlands. 
The houses are rough cut stone, plastered over and whitewashed. Roofs are flat and each home has a stone patio or courtyard that serves also as the entrance. Houses are typically two floors with high cielings to accomodate their occupants. On the first floor, houses often have wide kitchens that serve as a living space as well. Huge open concept spaces lend well to the communal nature of the Lakoshti people. Sleeping quarters are usually on the second floor, or if there is no second floor, in the back of the house, but it is not hard to find a cushion to nap on in any room. Most often, people sleep in individual hammocks to keep airflow and to leave space for horns to dangle over the sides. Kitchens have an icebox inset into the floor, and a ceramic range for cooking on, though this is done usually when the sun begins to set, including any cooking for the next day. Children are expected to clean dishes from the moment they can hold a cloth, but are usually free to roam during the day. 

Streets in Lakosti are frequently covered in thin sheets  hooked between houses. These sheets are made and maintained by the children who have not yet passed their rite of passage, which differs between Orc and Minotaur residents. The pattern on each sheet describes a song and its lyrics. It is tradition for each Coming-of age Minotaur to take one of the blankets they've worked on as a shawl on their first trading run. For the orcs, the song has to be performed in a foreign town and it has to be performed well enough to return with a coin. Some of the songs are ancient, reaching to the time before these people left the prison. Some are much more recent, as songs heard thrice don't usually get coin. Children and young adults practice and play constantly in the promenades that front the more public buildings, like the Xanarans. Despite this, Lakoshti doesn't produce many more bards. Many Quality performers, but few who have the knack for telling enrapturing stories.

Food is often fish, frequently preserved with salt from mines not far away in the badlands. A wide variety get caught and eaten, though many choice ones are preserved to be sold in Danzuishan, and sometimes shipped to Kara'ite. Clay pots are used for storage, but the largest ones are used to grow plants, sometimes for aesthetics but most often for food. Fig, Pomegranate, Citrus, and Olive trees double to provide shade, while carob, prickly pear, thyme and dittany sit low, often out along walls between the courtyards and the streets. Pearlescent and spicy Dragonpeas often snake their way up lattices on sunny building sides (a taste reminiscent of wasabi or horseradish).

One of the most striking facets of Lakosti is the colours on the streets, as the cobbles are all lapis grouted in gold, giving the impression of a river of blue shining in the sun

===== Environment =====
Lakosti is built in the badlands west of the Desert, on the edge of the sea of endless rain. The winds rarely carry rains to this place though, and it remains dry and hot all year round. Sandstone, conglomerates, and rare metamorphic rocks poke out from underneath thick clay mesas and tablelands. The Anapasi river, takes the deepest cut through its own canyons toward the sea, only diverting when it rains heavily, leaving the side channels still well worn. The Lakoshti people use widened and rocky sections of the river for mint, and sometimes include the more dry-tolerant applemint as part of their gardens. Aggressive scythecraws, a crustacean with aptly named cutting forward legs, hide under rocks in the Anapasi, and are both a delicious treat and a common source of shallow ankle wounds.  Giant toads often fight for territory in vicious battles among the water, but other than that, the area is without any large predators or common threats, altogether worth the heat. 

===== Economy =====
Lakosti's trade is partly in fish, partly in its relatively rare fruits and vegetables, a decent amount in salt, but mostly in the wool of the locally raised Squirrel-sheep. Despite being neither a squirrel nor a sheep, this goat-sized creature manages to have features of both, having both extremely dense fur as well as standing on its hind legs to eat any plants or seeds it can. The wool is amazingly soft and comes in two layers. The undercoat (which harms the creature none to regrow) holds on to water better than any other fabric until compressed, where the outercoat wicks moisture outward with incredible efficiency. The Lakoshti take great pains to keep the fibre of the second coat aligned properly, so that when they turn it into thread, moisture absorbed by the fibre gets drawn to the end of the fibre. Often they make such things into ponchos for sale, and rarely into extremely expensive canvas. The fibre is fire and mold resistant, but does little against cold, not that it's ever cold in the badlands. 
Some Of Lakoshti's wealth comes from mined gold and lapis, but with its major trading partner in Danzuishan having continual influx from the maze, goods are often expensive if paid in gold. 

==== Supply chain ====
	* Lakosti grows much of its food on the nutrient rich sediment that comes from the anapasi, and despite low rainfall, shrubs still make some living within a short radius of the anapasi
	* Salt, Lapis, and Gold are mined from the sedimentary rock nearby
	* Squirrel-sheep are grown on the scrubs, mint, reed, and from kitchen leavings, their wool is harvested into water-carrying and water-wicking fabric
	* Trade is most often done with Danzuishan and towns within the gannaga basin. 
	* Rare expeditions are made to the Ushlubarel or across the dragon coast to the Man'anan 
	* Lakosti imports mostly metals, dyes, fruits and spices they don't have, Coffee and tea in immense abundance, chocolate, and alcohol.
	* Truly the biggest import into Lakosti are stories, lies, and bullshit, which they're adept at categorising, and take great pleasure in spreading.

==== Other sociological notes ====
	* Lakosti is a gerontocracy. The 12 oldest of each orcs and minotaurs (24 total) tend to make up the government by default. On occasion someone of another race makes it into the council. It is more something that is recognized than formalised. Despite the informality, the council oversees all legal decisions in the town of about 700.
	* Culturally, the Lakoshti value physical strength, but largely in the framing of "what you have left when you have nothing". They see great value in magic, and even greater value in community, but their most told stories are all of people (rarely are they warriors) who lose everything and by their own intrinsic power, become victorious.
	* Many of the Cultural myths of Lakosti are built around Miros, a great hero who //could// live entirely by strength alone, the sweep of whose sword could lay armies low. Archaeological work has revealed that Miros was originally //Baphomet//, but the Lakosti have largely culturally divorced the mythical miros, who is emphatically compassionate, which is a departure from Baphomet's actual personality. No one is named Miros in Lakosti, but variants Like Mirosakes are extremely common.
	* Entertainment is hard won in lakosti, as there is much to do, but swimming in the Anapasi's many well known (and well mantained) swimming holes, or diving off the cliffs into the ocean is a common one. By night, stories are told in the amphitheatre, parties are held within homes. Sling competitions, wrestling, Searching for scythecraws and hunting all play a part.
	* The most important tradition in Lakosti is troublemaking,. On particularly boring, muggy, or restless nights, it is expected that at least one citizen, frequently a group, is going to make some form of trouble, and only rarely to plan it in advance, some examples include
		* running naked through the street, 
		* Turning all the landed boats in the harbour upside down.
		* Graffiti
		* Holding a party in some else's house, preferably after they've gone to sleep
		* Swapping all of the furniture in two houses
		* Moving a sound sleeper to another location
		* Putting a sleeping child in a large, specially made sock and pretending that they only ever had a sock to sleep in. This prank is only pulled once and young children are not to be let in on the grift until they're old enough to make trouble themselves
		* Being lifted upon a palanquin, wearing a crown (the more absurd and ostentatious the better), silly or skimpy clothing and declaring yourself "the king of the aegis", and demanding gifts from houses you pass.
	* Some of the most legendary forms of troublemaking include
		* Using magic to move someone's house from one side of town to another
		* Making an extremely detailed and rather large statue of a rich member of society out of dung that must have taken months to collect, then having it delivered by fey creatures.
		* Feeding enough fish a carefully made oxidising dye that harmlessly stains flesh a bright blue, packed in irresistable bait, so that nearly all of the fish caught in the sea of endless rain that year and occasionally others for three years after would turn blue about a day after being caught.
		* Inviting Konian and Manaharahi diplomats to Lakosti at the same time, giving them ludicrous "diplomatic outfits" and making them sleep in the same house, which is a converted boat shack. This Event may have precipitated in the war of ants
	* There are customs to be observed when troublemaking
		* Break nothing that cannot be replaced
		* You're on the hook for cleaning up the mess.
		* Do nothing malevolently
		* Avoid targetting the same people repeatedly, if it goes too far then people can take legal action, and revenge pranks can end up being cumulative.
		* Try not to consume too much of other people's food and drink
		* Don't target the elders. It's not illegal, it's just a bad idea, they know more pranks than you do and they always work together
	* And there are things that are understood when being the victim of troublemaking
		* if there is no permanent damage, it will be hard to get anyone to care. In Lakosti, you had better be strong enough to recover one sleepless night a month or overturning a boat once a year.
		* Revenge pranks are heavily discouraged unless someone has been targetting you specifically or unless you are an elder. Elders //only// revenge prank
		* Revenge pranks, when necessary merit help from neighbours, and it is good to help someone outprank their prankster.
	* There's a lack of Clerics and paladins in Lakosti, Not because of any lack of spirituality, but because the gods aren't as useful as one's own two hands most of the time. For this reason, much of the healthcare work is done by the handful of artificers bards, and druids, 
	* Stargazing is a common practice among the Lakoshti, inherited from their flight across the great grass road from the Ramishi. Many of their tales and works share origins with the Ramishi.
	* The Lakoshti historically were on bad terms with the people of Graoton, but occasional Grao fleets are now a welcome sight in the harbour.
	* Visitors by sea are warned to be careful, as children often dive off the docks to collect shellfish.
	* Sewage is dealt with by collecting waste in large urns, which are sealed and weekly brought up to one of the gulches away from the anapasi, smashed, then left to decompose. Every three years, the gulch is changed, And the one for next year is emptied (often as penance for crimes) and the decomposed refuse added to farms.
	* Water is collected in similarly large urn from the anapasi and carried back to the house to be placed in an elevated cistern on the second floor, or smaller ones upon a stand.
