====== The Ascended One ======
Created Saturday 19 August 2023

The Ascended One, The great dragon, Above all masters of the shadowfell, this one holds the greatest power over fear, for the Dragon is a predator. Nothing other than overwhelming force can defeat it, and the more overwhelming the force, the more it survives. The only creature in the shadowfell that can oppose the dragon without aid is the eightfold one, who rarely does anything at all. Tiamat and Bahamut both could overpower the ascended dragon temporarily, but neither can defeat it. 

The Ascended one reigns over the shadow dragons, who feed on the fear of predators, sometimes emerging as horrendous omens on dreams.


==== The Great Eerie Temple ====
	In deepest shadow, near the peak of the unyielding void, a great volcano, long dead, stands as a stark monolith among blasted plains. At the peak of the volcano is the eerie of the great dragon. Beyond ancient, massive in size and ponderous in magic power, The Ascended Dragon appears as a puddle of shadow in the volcano's heart, it seldom stirs, and this is good, for it revels in the fear of the powerful. Around the rim of the caldera, great gates serve as the roost of the shadow dragon masters, and those creatures who are worthy of them. Here an aspirant that doesn't get eaten, that feels only the lowest level of fear, can learn to develop their own fundamentum, channel draconic magic, or in rare cases, even become a dragon themselves.
	
	
=== Great ritual of Dragon Form ===
	This is perhaps the simplest temple ritual in the entire shadowfell. Throw yourself into the volcano, into the Ascended dragon, and however much of you is a dragon will consume the rest of you until only a dragon is left, however much that is. Escape quickly and you will not become a shadow dragon, and remain more capable of ego and wonder. Escape slowly and you become a shadow dragon, quiet of mind, immense of malice, not without intelligence but entirely devoid of wonder and curiosity. Most often, People fail to escape and what essence of them can feel fear //only// feels fear until the great dragon consumes them entirely
