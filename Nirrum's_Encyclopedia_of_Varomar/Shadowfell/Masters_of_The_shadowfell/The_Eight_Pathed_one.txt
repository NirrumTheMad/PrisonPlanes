====== The Eight Pathed one ======
Created Saturday 19 August 2023

Often a human-shaped creature, though not always, the Eight-pathed one, the webless spider, The unweaver always keeps a few of their normal legs available for use. It is said that the unweaver was of early tepet, and the intended sacrifice for the partial invocation of Karsus avatar in the early Manarahi's abjuration of Mystra when she attempted to chain the use of magic on the plane. Soaked in the great magics of the ancient betrahi, the unweaver rose with a knife to the throat of the goddess of magic and said "fuck off," and to her immense credit, she did.  Afterwards they descended into the shadowfell, gathering strength of magic in case any such bullshit ever again was attempted. Thus now, the Eight-Pathed one appears as a modestly tall human with pallid skin that is lined with continuously shifting marks that react to the flow of magic. From their back, the webless one has eight, somewhat stubby but usable arachnid legs they sometimes use for climbing walls, not that they need it. They wear baggy pants embroidered with gold images depicting a stormy sea and have six additional eyes on their forehead. In their existence, they have undergone eight journeys, to understand the origin, fate, and entropy of power, then to accept suffering, another for its cause, and how to stop suffering. Most recently, two more journeys are being undertaken, one to extend this lack of suffering to others, and a final one is portented. The webless one has designed a ritual to encompass each journey, so that others may understand deeply the lessons learned. Few have ever undertaken them, fewer still have understood even one, to the unweaver's immense disappointment and irritation.

The Eight Pathed one is followed by a host of magi who plumb the depths of magic in otherwise forbidden and dangerous ways. The shadowfell is uniquely suited to such research, as it is nearly impossible to do any actual damage to the plane, and consequences are few, though the undead are forbidden from the eight pathed one's presence, particularly vampires, who get eaten and consumed on sight. So too do the Mohara Aescetics train the highest levels of their practice. Drained by the shadowfell, these folk often lose a great deal of their courtesy, but rarely do they lose their purpose. The mastery of Magic is Manarahi birthright, and a safe family their inheritance, to be preserved at all costs, not uncommonly leading to fights between them and the others who come here.

The Eight pathed one also hosts a curious human monk in his company, who the webless spider calls "the peaceful one" who claims to follow and teach the Coincidentally named eightfold path, and not a small number of the magi who follow the spider end up following this one instead, finding peace more promising than power. Indeed, it is this monk that heralds the way to the Cave temple, as he glows an immense light of his own from the base of a very alive and old fig tree. It is said that the peaceful one was the tutor of the eight pathed one, and is merely waiting for the completion of all those journeys. 


	**You who spin my webs**
	**You who cast my spells**
	**You who force my fists**
	**You who drawn your own life**
	**What care have I for you?**

==== The Cave Temple ====
	In the depths of a forest that never lived, these followers have occupied a cave and built a temple within the corrupted corridors. The Cave mouth thrums with magic, only slightly attenuated from a great leyline node of the material plane. On Mohara, where the power plant feeds the entire Manaharahi civilization and its protectorates electrical energy, magic flows towards the void of the far realm, passing through this cave on the shadowfell on the way, which is why the webless one is here, pressed up against one of the gates to the material plane. In the labyrinthine channels, suckling on this magic, Mohara aescetics practice their craft in ways deeper than their home allows. 
	



=== Ritual of the first step - Origin ===
	//Energy moves from high density to low density. Things can only come from bigger things. If something small has great effect, then you underestimated its Karmic size. Potential Energy is still energy, and follows its laws. Understand that all things are inherited, and you will know what inheritance you offer//

The ritual of origin is a painful ordeal. By standing in the gateway between the shadowfell and the monastery on Mohara, you let power of all kinds flow through you, but as well, you feel what leaves you into the shadowfell. 

GONNA BE UHHH SOMETHING TO DO WITH YOUR HEALTH AND USING YOUR HIT DIE FOR DAMAGE

=== The Ritual of the second step - Fate ===
	//Energy will always attempt to reach equilibrium over time. All things are impermanent, just as waves return to the sea, as sound returns to silence, and as flesh returns to earth and light. Let energy flow, and it will reach its destination sooner, and with less fuss. //

GIVE UP LOWER LEVEL SPELL SLOTS TO GET HIGHER ONES OR VICE VERSA?

=== The Ritual of the third step - Entropy ===
	//As energy moves from one place to another, so long as a different place exists, some energy will be lost to that place along the journey. As the universe is quite large, energy will always be lost in any transfer. View this lost energy as the origin, know its fate, and understand that it too will experience entropy, and you will know the truth of the universe from birth to death to birth. //

REDUCE DAMAGE OR ROLLS TO  BUFF OTHER ROLLS? GIVE UP CRITS?


=== The Ritual of the fourth step - Annihilation ===
	//It is only when we expose ourselves to annihilation, again and again, that we find what is indestructible within us. Let go of yourself, let the universe become you.//

PRESTIGE HEALTH AND SPELL PROGRESSION, KEEP FEATURES?



=== The Ritual of the fifth step - Acceptance ===
	//The first truth is to understand that suffering exists. The universe has sharp edges, and many flows tumble around. To resist them is to get cut and abraded. To accept them as part of you is to be uncuttable. Accept the pain and you will not suffer. //
	
One of the most common rituals of the shadowfell, owing partly to its accessibility. A Mohara Aescetic, properly paid with food can guide you to a specially prepared stone chamber with a thick door.


RANDOM CLASS FEATURES STOP BEING RANDOM IF YOU SURVIVE

all summoned creatures are hostile, all targets are you
	special ..
	hostile .................
	Neutral ...........
	Good ....................
 

=== The Ritual of the sixth step - Cause ===
	//The second truth is that suffering exists because of what we cling to. Fear, expectation, attachment, and desire are all forms of ways we try to shape and see the future, and suffering is the difference between what is real and what we want to be real, what we cling to. Find what you cling to, know what causes you suffering.//
	
A river flows backward, up through the cave and out into the shadowfell, pushed by the flow of magic, but flowing all the same. Within these river, several fish placidly swim, though monks and magi both are wont to point out that many of them are not alive. Dead fish, they point out, can swim upriver if the water is turbulent. This is the basis of one of much of the movement of the path of eight steps


GET SOME TELEPORTS GOIN

=== The ritual of the seventh step - Cessation ===
	//The third truth is that Suffering can be stopped through deatchment. Let go of your fears, let go of your desires, let go of your expectation, let go of your earthly tethers. //
	
	
	REMOVE BLOODLINES, PACTS, LEAVES YOU WITH WHAT, MAGIC OR SOMETHING?



	


=== Great Ritual of the Eighth Step - Karma ===
	//By knowing the other steps, know that harm brings harm, that speaking brings speaking, the good brings good, that silence brings silence. As true as the traumatised can pass on trauma, as the educated can educate, and the fearful bring fear, so too is it that those who do not suffer can end suffering. Cause no suffering, allow yourself no suffering, and attenuate suffering wherever you find it, and you will know contentment, as it is your default state.//
