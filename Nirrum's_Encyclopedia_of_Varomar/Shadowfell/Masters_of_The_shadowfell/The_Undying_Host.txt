====== The Undying Host ======
Created Saturday 19 August 2023

Singularly selfish, no creature should embody the idea of life more than the Undying host. Unfortunately, they are more the disembodiment of death. A nearly shapeless ghost, barely capable of contiguous form at all. In Magical terms, the Host, the un-spectre, the Mawfog, the rotbringer, is the entity that knows the most about death.
