====== The Sun Soul ======
Created Saturday 19 August 2023

At the pinnacle of the light, in the roar of the baleful desert one might find a great skeleton, Wreathed in flame, whose skull is but a ghost. Hirokira. Olopi. The Sun soul eclipses most of the horrors of the realm beyond the stars with its blinding inferno. Together with the Warden of Lightning, it keeps the nearby prisons safe. Hirokira devours great powers to fuel itself, but in doing so, it releases great power in excess. The sun sould protects its body while its head gathers food and continues chasing the greatest prize, Allabar, opener of the way. Light floods to this place in the shadowfell, fleeing the dark toward the greatest escape. The Sun Soul sits immobile usually, though occasionally it rises to deal with shadowfell threats, as the shadowfell is always hungry beyond any power that dwells within it.


==== The Rope Temple ====
	It is hard for things to withstand the intense light of hirokira for too long, Particularly this close. So around Hirokira are Sixteen Tall pillars that stretch their shadows far into the distance so people can approach. Then, at the base of these pillars are  Pergolas, woven with rope to allow some light in, but to occlude much, and as well to let cooler air drift through the temple. Here the light is filled with such raucous magic that it is easy to hold, experiment with, and play with. 
	
	

=== The Rainbow Ritual ===
	The light within comes in many colours, and by replacing the light of your own with the light of the sun, you can  change what that light means. The rainbow ritual allows you to  change what colours you are as well as what colours you can percieve. Most creatures start with red, green, and blue, though an additional infrared (darkvision) or occasional ultraviolet receptor is not uncommon, and octarine is common among the Manarahi or mages. You can replace the receptors for any one of these with any other, though you cannot exceed the ones you started with. If you do, you lose the ability to see the other colour at all. Through careful planning or by replacing your eyes with the eyes of another, compatible creature, you may be able to change how many receptor types you have, but messing with your own vision is a dangerous and delicate task. The rainbow ritual simply requires a period of meditation, which can be done all at once or in parts, but usually takes about a week to perfect the results


=== The Ascenscion ritual ===
	Climb the skeleton, and you don't die, congrats, you're now in space and can either leave the prison planes or return to the surface of one, depending on what magic you have prepared.
