====== The Valent One ======
Created Monday 28 August 2023

To ask "what am I" is a question that fuels the shadowfell. It is a selfish, singular question with many many answers, few of them satisfying. Some turn inward, some turn outward, some look at what they compose, and a few look at what they are composed of and the ways those can be changed. The valent one plucked their composition like the string on a harp and now oscillates wildly between immovable and unplaceable, between metaplasmas to condensates, From dense to sparse. They are the most abhorrent thing to the nature of the shadowfell, and it is for this reason that they are here. The valent one cannot leave the shadowfell, or they would fall apart, but the isolating powers of the shadowfell act in concert to keep them together. In these states, they are one with the things that are similar to them. They can become the land, the air, the water, the very movement of things is part of who they are. Perhaps it is better to say that the identity of these things contributes in part to the entropy of the valent one, the composite soul, the Elemental Ogre. They often take the shape of a dwarf when they can keep a shape. 


==== Darkwater Rift Temple ====
	The elemental ogre rather purposefully built the Darkwater Rift Temple, so supplicants could venerate them but also so they could learn more of physics. Indeed, the composite soul is a master physicist (And a legendarily poor sociologist, strangely competent linguist, and hobby tuba player). On a very unreasonably active volcano in one of the shadow seas, situated on a sheer cliff of very crumbly igneous rock gathered around a cobalt pillar that acts as its support against the bones of the world, a bowl-shaped panopticon supports one of the more functional locales in the shadowfell. Supplicants who reach the temple must show their devotions to the valent one each day when they wake, but in return are granted a small personal chamber which are usually single-occupancy rooms, with some exceptions. Food can be caught from the seas, though nutrition is slim. At the base of the tower that occupies the middle of the bowl is the Elemental forum, and it is there that the valent one mingles with the supplicants, aspirants, and colleagues as they try to unlock answers to the question of what makes living beings tick. As far as the shadowfell goes it is rather chummy, easy to make friends, but don't be fooled, sometimes people are needed for experiments, to prove a point, or sometimes rooms get in short supply and things get competetive.
