====== The Valent One ======
Created Monday 28 August 2023

To ask "what am I" is a question that fuels the shadowfell. It is a selfish, singular question with many many answers, few of them satisfying. Some turn inward, some turn outward, some look at what they compose, and a few look at what they are composed of and the ways those can be changed. The valent one plucked their composition like the string on a harp and now oscillates wildly between immovable and unplaceable, between metaplasmas to condensates, From dense to sparse. They are the most abhorrent thing to the nature of the shadowfell, and it is for this reason that they are here. The valent one cannot leave the shadowfell, or they would fall apart, but the isolating powers of the shadowfell act in concert to keep them together. In these states, they are one with the things that are similar to them. They can become the land, the air, the water, the very movement of things is part of who they are. Perhaps it is better to say that the identity of these things contributes in part to the entropy of the valent one, the composite soul, the Elemental Ogre. They often take the shape of a dwarf when they can keep a shape. 


==== Darkwater Rift Temple ====
	The elemental ogre is best observed from the darkwater rift temple. On a very unreasonably active volcano in one of the shadow seas, situated on a sheer cliff of very crumbly igneous rock gathered around a cobalt pillar that acts as its support against the bones of the world, a bowl-shaped panopticon that is open on one side. The Valent one seeks to understand and to strip apart all things to find new ways to understand themself, very frequently at the cost of others. While the elemental ogre is approachable while working at the centre of the theatre, it is dangerous to do so. The risk to become part of the experiment or to witness any experiment's completion is always there. The Valent one is responsible for many monstrosities and variations on monstrosities, and it is a coin's toss chance if any cell is being used presently to house a researcher of some sort or one of the monstrosities that the valent on is not done with. Storms often wrack the area with cold rain, so unless you have shelter, it is best to wait out the rain in an open cell.
	


=== Ritual of frozen eyes ===
	If a person is willing to gouge out their eyes and lose all colour vision (though not darkvision, if they were capable), they might be able to use some of the frozen rainwater that bounces off the valent one to fashion some new eyes, eyes that, once per day, can force a creature you can see within 30ft of you to make a constitution saving throw against 8+Your Charisma modifier+Your constitution modifier. On a success they are immune to this ability for a week. On a failure, they are Restrained. At the end of their next turn they must attempt the saving throw again. On a success they are freed, on a failure, they are incapacitated. On the next turn, they must attempt again, being freed on a success or paralyzed on a failure. A condition caused by this ability lasts 1 minute or until you end it by looking away for a round (no action required)

=== Ritual of iron fur ===
	With an infusion of hop beer, a lot of patience, and mud washed off of the valent one, one can cause retractable and microscopic iron fibres to grow from one's skin. Gain a climb speed equal to your own. You only need exposed skin to hang on to any solid surface passively. You are now vulnerable to lightning damage. If you were resistant to lightning damage, you lose that resistance.

=== Ritual of Water Adaption ===
	By mixing your blood with the water that comes off of the valent one on a dry day, and that with an equal amount of the blood of a freshly killed fish, one is able to lose their ability to survive on land, and gains adaptations for living in water. This is reversible with the same ritual, replacing the fresh fish blood with fresh blood of a terrestrial species. 
	
=== Ritual of the comet ===
	Burning yourself with the flame of the valent one is enough to teach you his secret of flight, and its cost. Make a pyre out of bones and set yourself ablaze to gain an unlimited fly speed of 180ft, but contact with water will forever deal 1d6 damage per round, and you become vulnerable to cold damage. If you were resistant, you instead lose this resistance.
