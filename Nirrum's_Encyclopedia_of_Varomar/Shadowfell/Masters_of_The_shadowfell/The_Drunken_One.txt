====== The Drunken One ======
Created Saturday 19 August 2023

Of all masters of the shadowfell, None are so ephemeral, so capable of formlessness as the drunken one, The unhinged lord, the edgeless. It is hard to say that any creature touches the realm of death as much as the drunken one does, pressed up against the glass of the grave, constantly dissolved in substance. Consciousness is pain to the drunken one, Identity is a shackle. When they do form, usually to find new substances with which to bring them to the brink, they take the form of a great grinning tiefling. 

The Drunken one holds sway and bargaining power with fiends, hags, and mages that come to take part in their great rituals

	**Where can I not be? Why do I persist**
	**Are all realms are my tomb?**
	**The pain is less here, but still**
	**Where is my wine?**


==== The Wide roof temple ====
	Where the grey overcast of both halves of the shadowfell is at its most indistinct, A massive roof stretches over a plain. A great cloud of smoke pours out from its shingles, and a very foul smelling river turns much of the landscape to one side into barren swamp, home to loud frogs, strange crawling things, and sickly slime. The Wide Roof Temple is the best place in the universe to relax, never unrelax, and lose yourself to the ravings of other fellow addicts. It is the grave of all ambition, and not a good place. Underneath the wide roof temple is of course, camps set up by supplicants who share in their offerings, as well as wanderers, mislead by what feels like an island of stability. The roof is held up by impossibly tall stone pillars, spaced fairly evenly, but with no walls. Near the centre of the wide roof is a small mound around which there is nothing for nearly a mile. Getting too close to the mound subjects you to the whim of the Drunken one, whose formless semiconciousness occupies the hill.
	


=== The Dissolute Ritual ===
	The Dissolute ritual can only be performed with careful preparation. A potent solution of stimulants and poisons that induce anxiety must be consumed and be active beforehand. Then, one must carry a massive barrel of extremely potent disassociatives bound in hemp rope to the hill where the Drunken one slumbers, then, when you reach the hill in the centre, run as fast as you can out, through the river of piss, mostly as it is your clearest guide. The stimulants will keep you intact, the dissociatives will calm the edgless. It is best to go naked, as you will come out naked and that's just a net loss. The dissolute ritual is the most surefire way to remove exogenous incursion on identity, including a wide variety of mental health problems. It takes everything that you don't think as your identity and eats it. Everything that isn't part of what's being held together by those stimulants  leaves. Invariably one has some memory loss, but usually you come out mostly as you went in. The ritual can fail and a moment's distraction makes the entirety of your being become one with the drunken one, instead of what you're holding onto escaping

=== The Pissriver Ritual ===
	The drunken one is most limited by the need for new physical substances. As these substances make their way through the unhinged one (and most of the supplicants), they lose their potency, and become waste, but the waste of the unhinged lord has a special property. Pure, concentrated consciousness supporting chemical and alchemical compounds infuse the stream. So do some of the weakened drugs from the supplicants and it is //still// a river of piss. You'll have to do some advanced chemistry and alchemy to get even a small amount of this superstimulant. 

=== Farsight Frogs ===
	ahhhh so that's where they came from. They act like mostly normal frogs in this environment
