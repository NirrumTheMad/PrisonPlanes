====== The Merciful One ======
Created Monday 28 August 2023

	When one loses everything, one loses their chains. The blurred line, the Oni of hope, the irrelevantite, the merciful one is the title of a creature that lost and never stopped losing. At some point in its existence, the oni had much to celebrate. Children, family, land, a guaranteed place at the side of their god, perhaps the chance to become a god, all of the sources of good pleasure a being could fit in a day, but all things are impermanent, and as the eight-pathed one is wont to say: Energy flows from high to low, as water rushes to fill a pit. The jealousy, ambition, pride, desire of others all conspired in a cosmic alignment of bad days. Most creatures that one finds in here will //enter// the shadowfell at some point. the irrelevantite fell so low and lost so much that the shadowfell was simply there. There was nowhere else they could be. The hells of many realms are described as a place where all creatures are imprisoned in some way, but it is only the shadowfell that could allow such a creature as this to exist without simply turning to uninspired wind. The blurred line appears unremarkable, regardless of what creature looks on them. Its shape is humanoid, certainly, but no other characteristic seems to stick. 
	
	As its tears dried up, its bile ceased, as its blood cracked and its voice stilled, the only thing that moved in the husk of the merciful one was the yet dripping waterfall of loss. It chose with what was left of its mind to keep that flow going. It was all it had. So it took the hope from others, took all they were attached to and stole it from them, left them knowing that they had nothing, could have nothing they wanted, and wanted nothing they could have. It tore things apart until the only thing that remained was the sense of loss. The oni of hope is not a predator of particular skill, and those that carry little with them have an easy time avoiding their attention in particular if it means to study their work. But be warned. Only one thing can take more from you than the blurred line can and that is the shadowfell. Only one creature knows more of death, and that is the mawfog. Only two creatures know more about suffering, they are the webless one and his monk guest. Only one thing knows more about the pieces you are made of, and that is the valent one. This is a truth of the shadowfell. The oni of hope is second place in  many things, but unmatched in determination to cause a sense of loss. They are a great source of conflict among the masters of the shadowfell, though have a respectful kinship with the Shadow, who does similar work.
	
	**I have fallen farther than any creature**
	**I have known more pain than any being**
	**Hope is a trap**
	**Let me free you from it**
	
	

==== The Disfirmary Temple ====
	This clinical house of healing is more akin to a butcher's shop in its contents. The Merciful one goes from room to room, slowly checking up on the progress of its targets. There are many nooks and crannies that the oni of hope does not look, plenty of places to squirrel away and rest. The complex is massive, built by researchers who want more room and time to study. Magefired light tan Bricks stacked in mostly rectangular chunks, sometimes multiple floors high (under the stairs is often a good place to hide, but not always) make up the majority of the complex. The only condition of building new parts onto this hospital is to avoid blocking the entrance. The entrance is a large chunk of obsidian with a skeleton in repose embedded, partially uncovered reaching above it, as if it were attempting to crawl toward a second, smaller skeleton which is also partially uncovered, Under which are runes that are in no script I can trace the origin of, but have translated here all the same. "May all beings feel mercy"


=== Ritual of Homunculotomy ===
	This is the most reliable and cost-effective way to make a homunculus and graft its parts onto living beings, allowing bodies to be customised with more precision than most people are willing to suffer. All that is required is shadowfell clay, shadowfell glass, and an unreasonable amount of blood. Thankfully the blood can be from any creature, though in this context, it rarely is. Observing the blurred line while it makes one such creature is the best way to get the technique right. Just bring some earplugs, they scream when it rips them apart.
	

=== Ritual of the Goodbeetle ===
	A relished favourite of the irrelevantite, as is evidenced by what can only be described as a "happy little dance" as it moves to prepare the requisite beetle for the ritual. Perhaps this is the last shred of the creature it once was. The dance is brief all the same, the shadowfell is the only thing with less, or perhaps more mercy. Consuming a goodbeetle, alive and whole, means that one never has to eat or drink ever again, and indeed, may have great difficulty doing so. All nutrition is permanently taken care of as the beetle inside you perpetually generates food and water, which your body quickly adapts to, losing the capacity almost entirely for other foods. The Beetle does die shortly after you do, unless someone manages to recover it from your stomach. It is not hard to locate as it only stops screaming once it's out of your stomach acid, though this sound is entirely muffled while it's within you. The beetle is a dung beetle, or some relative we're not sure. With all its legs removed, its mouth and eyes covered in clay, marked with runes. After placing the runes, the oni of hope is always exhausted, but spares enough energy for the next step. It must always fight off the hoard of thieves that attempt to steal the beetle from it. More than once it has faked the ritual to capture all of the thieves that sought this prize. Good luck on retrieving it. 
	

=== Ritual of Endless Harm ===
	This is the foulest dessecration of decency, the most asocial, horrid curse you can place upon someone. It holds no place in justice. The devils of the hells themselves view it as unreasonable, the demons of the  abyss view it as unecessary, and hags view it as excessive. Those far beings who drift in the realm around the prison are often repulsed by it, and on occasion, drawn to it. To perform this act upon another creature is to be immediately abandoned and shunned by nearly every god, and often feared by the ones who do not shun you. You //will// be targetted by cosmic justice. Upon completion of the ritual, the subject lies lifeless, limp, and in most other ways, inert to the worl. Even if the body is destroyed and scattered, so long as a shred of the soul remains whole. Within their mind a cycle repeats. Gain and loss. Gain and loss. Expectation and defeat, unfulfillable desire,  For nearly every mechanism the brain has to deal with the world it is shown that it can fail, and as soon as the pain begins to numb a new dream begins with the same theme. There is no greater pain. No physical experience can compare to this. Around the Disfirmary temple, there are rooms where people who have undergone this ritual hang from hooks, often little more than a head, but endlessly bleeding. Collect this blood and utter a specially devious incantation, which I will not record here. Douse the target with the blood and they will fall catatonic forever. If there was ever a place to draw the line at what is recorded in this tome, it is the full instructions. This ritual is, however, not infallable, or inescapable. The Eight Pathed One was freed from it by their friend, the peaceful one, and there are recorded instances of others escaping it on their own, some simply passing away, others managing to escape their situation, what the trigger for this is, we do not know, just that it exists. The Eight pathed one, loathe to speak of it, has none the less confirmed it is "rushing samsara"
