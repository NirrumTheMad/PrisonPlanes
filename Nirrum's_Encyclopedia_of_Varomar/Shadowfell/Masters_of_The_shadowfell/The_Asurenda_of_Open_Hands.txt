====== The Asurenda of Open Hands ======
Created Saturday 19 August 2023

The Open hand is the culmination of ki, the fullest realisation of internal energies, and in this, the Asurenda is unmatched. Prideful, Attached to their skill, the Asurenda of Open hands was once an abbott of a monastery that was consumed by the shadowfell. Fearing death as the end of their skill, the abbott focused all of what they knew into the cultivated energy and kept the draining energies of the shadowfell at bay until they walked into the light, where they found the energies being gathered to them. There they rebuilt their monastery, there they remain a teacher. They have frequent discussions with the eightfold one, who they consider an ally. They are frequently hunted by the Sword Saint, and often come to blows with the death warden. Their form is that of a six armed humanoid with long mandibular tusks and wild white hair whose brick red  skin barely hangs on to their very visible skeleton, 

==== Two Thousand Bell Temple ====

	On the side of a hill, rising slowly to the cusp, the Dark green, Copper, and amethyst walls of the Two thousand bell temple support its marble-white roof. At the centre is a large tower shaped like two hands holding on to six great chains, upon which 1998 bells hang, with two more flanking the door. The majority of these bells have never rung more than once, as they ring when someone stands at the top of the tower and unleashes all of their ki. The 1998 bells can all be rung at once by the Asurenda of open hands, with the last two being beyond their power. The hall within has floors only accessible by magic, ki, or the judicious use of building supplies. It has cultivation rooms in which monastics meditate and try to enhance, alter, or refine what it means to be themselves. 
	
	
	

=== The ritual of the perfect hand ===
	A honed body makes for the first step of perfecting the open hand. Achieving an athletics check of over 25 to roll a boulder up the hill grants you audience with one of the monastics. A suitable one will teach you the form of the strike, and then force you to strike them as the perform the same strike. When your hand no longer hurts, they will step out of the way, and you will be capable of projecting your ki as though it were the powers of the ring of the ram, and can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier
