====== The Astral Emissary ======
Created Saturday 19 August 2023

Across all of space and time, across all realms, where the unity of karmic reality is almost fully realised, one will less find than realise the Astral Plane. A place where time and space don't have nearly as much meaning as they do elsewhere, where transcendental energy is proportionate to its effect. This is where gods go to die, and often where they are born. This unlimited plane sometimes collapses in regions to both form and connect to the other projections of reality. The Astral Emissary is a being who is both the portal to and a part of this astral plane. It manifests as a great worm made of water. Within its core, one can see the stars that line what passes for a digestive tract. The Emissary is not picky on what it consumes, and to it, many things are not what they seem to others. It speaks often, but cryptically.

	**I am sung from the highest realms**
	**The world that answers me is my prison**
	**I slide through its gaps, eating its promises**
	**Know truth: We are both more than this place allows us to be**


==== Temple of the Tower Well ====
	In a cemetery of endless graves, grown by the spirits of those who had none, near the hollow church of a demigod orphan whose name was lost, there is a fountain that issues water that tastes of copper. While harmless to drink, the water does trace a channel through the cemetery before falling through a grate into a long, deep well. Descending this well, one will find alcoves inset into the wall with aspirants learning to control their astral form under the tutelage of the Astral emissary, provided that it is not hungry. The great worm sometimes ascends the well to feed, to attend to matters in the shadowfell, and to teach. The bottom of the well, nearly a mile deep, opens into a pool of clear water, in which one can sometimes see the inner stars of the star-slug as it swims. Some of the residents of the Tower Well claim there is a secret hidden in the waters, but none wish to enter the water while the worm is in residence, lest they be consumed.

=== Ritual of Untethered Flight ===
	The astral plane connects all realms without space or time to really bog one down. The Only major dimensions of the astral plane are Identity and the amount of information you'll need to sort through to find what you are looking for. In this way, it is easy to //leave// wherever you are and go somewhere else. On snarl this is particularly difficult to accomplish but with the ritual of untethered flight, you can unlock snarl's hold on you. Afterwards, a simple plane shift from the shadowfell is enough to get back to your universe of origin, at least approximately. A banishment or banishing strike will easily send you on your journey across the cosmos. With 100gp of silver in an ornate bar and a jacinth worth 1000gp and 10gp worth of paper and ink, You can perform a partial astral projection that allows part of your soul to enter a different plane. If you find the plane of your home, you can attune to it. Once you have done so you have to find your way back to your original body, re-enter your body without complications, and then you have to drink of the water from the bottom of the tower well, which is what fully severs your tie to the prison plane.
	

=== Great Ritual of Unlimited energy ===
	Have you ever wondered how the first gods were born? Across endless aeons, across all epochs, across the conceptual astral plane, long before it was filled with the bodies of gods, the path to godhood takes one form above all. Separate the energies of the universe around you, their pressure building, until they begin drawing energy toward themselves, and you stand between them, controlling their collapse. The first step in this is invariably some form of the great ritual of Unlimited Energy. One must scribe the two thousand, seven hundred and seventy one Sigils that the Astral emissary dictates.
