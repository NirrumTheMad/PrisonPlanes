heheh, Shadowfellas


There are a staggering number of beings that call the shadowfell home. Most of them are awful, hateful creatures that even devils are loathe to consort with, embittered by what little life could offer them, and emboldened by what they could take in recompense. Several of them are monsters made by malice or madness, sometimes both. A good number are the dregs of what people could not let go of. Above them all stand the masters of the shadowfell. Each master of the shadowfell has clawed power from that dread demesne which itself has claimed part of them. Those mortals who do not know the power of the self cannot know what it means to be a master of the shadowfell. It is in those beings that know what must be done to reach such a state that you can find the true fear of what these beings are. Often, even the direct action of gods is barely enough to quell them, and could they be defeated by such measures, they all would have been.

But at the shores of a flood, soil is rich and moist, and similarly, so too do many things flock toward these masters, seeking to gain from their leavings, their insights, and their works. Merely being in the presence of some is enough to provide immense power, even though every one of them is lethally dangerous. None of the masters of the shadowfell care for the lives of others in a deep sense. Most are brazenly apathetic, and a few are hostile in degrees beyond comprehension to anything else that moves.

In their searches for answers, for power, they often clash 

==== Great Rituals ====

	The shadowfell is made of deep wells of power, and that power is there for the taking in many cases. The masters of the shadowfell are called such because they accomplished the task of making a //great ritual. //Great rituals are magical undertakings that allow a creature to utterly surpass mortality, To entirely exceed the bounds of their conditions and become something greater by far. You must give up a large portion of yourself to accomplish this, it is the price the shadowfell demands, but for those who pay that price, the power is beyond what mere mages and warriors can accomplish. The heights gained from these rituals never match the masters of the shadowfell, whose very beings are changed in order to design these rituals, but they are a great step
		**DM's Note:** Taking on a great ritual is removing a character from the game. When people end up as dragons, beings of cosmic fire, Immortals, and gods, they're not really playing the same game anymore. This is an excellent excuse to try another system.
