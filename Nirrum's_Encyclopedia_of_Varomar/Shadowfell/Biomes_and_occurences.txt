====== Biomes and occurences ======
Created Friday 01 September 2023

It is perhaps wrong to call anything in the shadowfell a biome. Much of the shadowfell is artificial, shaped by thought, and all too often shaped by the darker, isolating thoughts people experience. Not unlike the feywild, very little of what is there makes sense. There is not much to keep track of as you walk, and little to interrupt your thoughts

==== Blasted deserts ====
	not infrequently endless tracks of sand. No dunes, no mountains, just sand and occasional gravel for as far as the eye can see. Nothing can sneak up on you here, but there is also nowhere to hide.
	

==== Dead woods ====
	Forests of every type imaginable, devoid of leaf or animal or anything living, just the sign that things once should have been. Some parts of these places are overgrown thickets of impassible thorn and branch, others are sparse fields of singular pillars of rotting wood. Occasionally some trees are made of tougher stuff, and grow despite the shadowfell's hunger. These are the rare neverwood trees, and they make excellent staves for the wicked
	

==== Cemeteries ====
	When people die and don't get graves, these form, usually over the course of a few weeks per stone. The stone have no names or identifying information, and are usually in a shape that the person thought about at some point in their lives. These stones often appear near eachother, as if they're lonely. Obelisks often mark the beginnings  of new graves. The shadowfell is not without beauty though, as often these poignant, quiet stones are overgrown by Vilified Soulflower Vines. Soulflowers are an uncommon bloom, even in the many planes that they grow, needing precise conditions to get them to grow. 
		Vilified soulflowers grow from the graves of people buried unceremoniously that aren't particularly bitter about their abandonment, provided a seed finds such a grave. The white six-petalled bloom sheds its pollen as dust on any creature that disturbs it. The nectar within contains an immensely potent necromantic and transfigurative catalyst. The seed pod is a lethal poison (20d6, ingested, 10d6 contact), but the oil of a properly crushed seedpod, once boiled, can be used for a true resurrection spell, cast with as low as a first level spell slot. The Vine is woody, and can also be used to make wands
	

==== Oceans ====
	Extremely saline oceans dot the shadowfell. Some drop off quickly, reaching unreasonable depths with immense speed. Some never seem to get much deeper than one's knee or chest.  Both contain monsters. The former contain great serpents of shadow, the latter, horrible blind tadpoles writhing in sandy muck. Both are slimy to the touch, and horrendously dehydrating. They are both rather high in proteins, though tracing these is difficult as very little grows here
	

==== The Shadows under the Shadows. ====
	Where rock manages to hold in the shadowfell, where rivers manage to flow, some can find the maws of the dripping depths of the world beneath the shadowfell. For some creatures of the infinite far realm, this is a soft, warm place of vile rest. For everything else it is worse than the grave. Death is not a guarantee in the voidlands beneath the shadowfell. So close to both the bounds of the negative energy plane, the far realm, and undoubtedly several layers of the abyss, those things that hate light might find a home here, among each other. Be warned, traveller. This is not a place worth going. Don't even send your curses this way, do not abandon your whispers here.
