"The other day, When I was in the kitchen cleaning dishes, a soap bubble started screaming at me. **Screaming.** I have no idea why, but at some point I asked it to calm down, and it repeated the words "calm down". My soap bubble started talking to me after it figured out that it could.  So I'm standing there and it tells me that it needs more soap but when I add some more concentrated soap, it started screaming in what I can only assume was pain, so I added some more water and the screaming went down, and  in the process another bubble drifted over and //my// bubble started screaming about being attacked so I popped the bubble that was attached to my bubble and everything was quet for a bit and I just kinda cleared out space around my bubble with my finger and the bubble started asking me questions, like could I make it live longer because it was dying pretty quickly, so I added some chemical glue and then that worked but the other bubbles stopped popping as well, and never were able to bump into eachother or separate or move and they didn't like that and a few of them figured out how to talk so I scooped up my bubble in a jar but that caused it to pop and I flushed the rest down the sink, and It hasn't happened since and AAAAA.... So how was your day?"
 
The Far Realm is not so far from the prison planes, indeed, most of them are set within the far realm, where the stars have a habit of moving and planelet is more accurate than planet.
