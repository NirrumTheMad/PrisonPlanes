* **Magic:**
	* Thaums are the strength of a magical field, and dictates the potency of magical effects in the area. The average ambient magical intensity in a vaccuum is approximately negative one thaum per cubic meter. The actual number of a vacuum is approximately .003 thaums per cubic meter but this has to do with the inverse square law and the omnipresent magical field that pervades existence. Thaumatic presence will still magical compasses. The negative one comes as a result of Morowal's Thesis, which proves that in an ideal scenario, the density of Mana will surpass the actual capacity of the universe to hold it, forcing the universe to "lose entropy", though there is much heavy and on occasion lethal debate on that part. "A Thaum is the basic unit of magical strength. It has been universally established as the amount of magic needed to create one small white pigeon or three normal-sized billiard balls."
	* **Mana is the presence of ambient magic**, and has an inverse relationship with thaums. Mana moves out of areas with high Thaums. If it didn't spells would cast explosively. Thaumatic fields are generated by magical effects in correspondence to the mana channelled to cast them.  Think of Thaums as ice hills and Mana as water. Freeze the water and it expands to become a hill, Melt the ice, return the water.  Sufficiently high mana can overwhelm a thaumatic field and cause a chain reaction, sufficiently dense placed thaumatic fields can contain mana which allows for magic to be amplified. Wild Magic sorcerers tend to be people who emit, for some reason, a bowl-shaped thaumatic field, causing magic to go haywire around them. Most   arcane rituals use this, funnelling magic through pre-determined paths in a thaumatic field. The perfection of each ritual is astounding, and to do it properly freeform would be almost certainly suicide. Creatures that can channel large amounts of magic can"test" their circle as they make it, changing it to nearly effortless, Hence spell-level restrictions on rote ritual. Mana has a "positive spin" when measured with a magical compass, and by extension, magical compasses tend to point *away* from the largest sources of acitve magical effects, which would be in large thaumatic fields of low Mana Density. Though the presence of a high Thaumatic field or a High Mana Density does not preclude the other, as seen in rituals.
	* Narrativium Is the total value of magic in a space, measured in pterries. It can be calculated as a function of Thaums, being the maximum ideal magnitude of a thamautic field if it were to perfectly consume all mana in a volume. Rincewind's Formula is the ideal way to calculate the amount of narrativium in an area, which takes the smallest spell at 100% efficiency and multiplies it by its total hypervolume, requiring height, width, length and metaduration of the zone to be measured. This is normally straightforward as the metaduration of most spaces can be calculated by applying Einstein's theory of special relativity, but in the event of the use of spells such as time stop, wish, or just about anything composed by the wizard Mordenkainen, the calculation must factor in the difference in spacetime's own fluctuations and how reality adjusts for that. Narrativium is ultimately a measure of **How much the laws of the universe can be subverted or changed. **//It is intrinsically linked to planck's constant and the subject of the fabric of spacetime. This description of metauniversal law is thought to be at stable equillibrium already, and that sufficient magic can destabilize it.//
	* Residuum is the crystalization of Mana and happens when opposing magical fields try to reverse each other. Residuum interacts as if it were baryonic matter, and seems to mirror electromagnetic forces, allowing it to be touched, held, and carried as if it were dust. Residuum has a half life somehow related to  the (cube root of (twice the intensity of of the thaumatic field Multiplied by the Mana level, divided by c squared)). If I were a physicist, this would be far more in depth.
	* Humes is a measure of the difference between Quantum and Narrativium. Once used on the forgotten world of earth, it is closely tied with rincewind's formula. Narrativium interacts with Quantum, usually by repelling it, thus, humes is a measure of reality, wherein causality is actively predictable and follows clear set laws. There is much philosophical debate about the nature of determinism as opposed to true random, Archbard Nirrum, master of knowledge, lord of words, King of Truth and Lies, and all-round cool guy, poses the idea of metadeterminism. Where Narrativium flaunts what is otherwise universal law and Quantumn adheres by it, one can say that the amount of Narrativium is the ultimate measure of the universe's energy and that Quantum is the measure of its entropic state, that is, what reality does when it is least agitated. Thus, to measure Humes, the best way is to test and see how slow the speed of light in a vacuum is in any given magical field. The slower, the more magical. 
		* It is worth mentioning that there is no known source of or definition of the metauniversal amount of Narrativium, which is to say //no one knows if the paradox of a spell that makes more magic where there was none// even can be resolved. There may be no end to the amount of Looney-toons action we're invited to so strap in for.
		* It is also worth mentioning that the original idea of humes came up when someone, presumably humes themselves said "the more magic there seems to be, the less real everything is".
		* **You can honestly just pick up a Humesian Physics book in my library to get this sort of information though**
	* Snarl's shape is best described as a elliptical dodecahedract, a shape with five spatial dimensions. Looking into Snarl from the outside, you normally would see the surface world as an ellipse from all normally accessible angles. In another projection, it is a dodecahedron with the peculiar aspect of folding in on itself. In another projection it is conoid, and honestly that one is probably the most important, as in the view one would hypothetically be able to see Teruna being pinned by the plane to the fabric of the universe. This awkward shape is unfortunately one of the reasons it's so difficult to actually leave the plane once you're here. A banish spell or similar might work for most newcomers but after being on the plane for too long, options become extremely rare. 
	* Octarine is visible to the attuned through the equivalent of Magical rayleigh scattering. I'm pretty sure I have a ritual here for attuning someone to Octarine here. Y'know. For the Normies.

* **Fey Magic and Manakaora**
	* On a fundamental level, fey magic and really fey life is powered by memetic potential. Where minds can affect magic, it is easy to see the many ways that an idea can be used to produce change. Instead of energy condensing fully into matter as in the prime material plane (the humanbonkers as it is sometimes referred to), it condensed into the opposite side of the matter-mind equation. The University is still studying the atomicity of this unit but the most notable form of it is best known as Kaorasha, which describes the configurations of fundamental forces in a way that  can produce a single logical gate  in practice. In this case, OR and NOT gates can be made. While configurations exist on a simpler level, they are not informationally useful
	* Kaorasha has properties not unlike physical matter in its own context, it has a degree of attractive force that is stronger than a degree of repellent force at a rate inversely proportionate the square of the distance. We believe these forces to be less stable and dense than those on the prime material, at the benefit of being more malleable with less energy. 
	* the most common configuration of Kaorasha is the "manameme"  or Manakaora, which is the smallest known Kaorasha that can affect mana. 
	* Manakaora exist in one of three states each with two configurations. Positive or Negative potential, Mu-Activation or Re-Activation,  and sticky or polished harmony. 
		* Potential is the energy state. From our perspective and with our forms of mathematics, it is very clear that every Manameme is a net-0 system internally and //technically//, and we suspect the sub-kaora particles have some sort of intrinsic harmony to them. This potential is expressed as  p+ or p- depending on its direction. This is a special potential as it is absolute. With high-energy systems one can achieve a p-- or p++ potential, but this approaches one of the humesian limits, and without careful dampening, this can hit either the positive or negative energy plane and cause a rift. in a Compound, the additive potential of p- and p+ never reach that limit and operate with the inverse square law. if a p- and p+ manakaora interact perfectly, they annihilate and produce mana. Often, an imperfect annihilation occurs and mana, light, and a single manakaora of either potential remain, composed of the features of either or both manakaora. Partial-incomplete Manakaora annihilations also occur where one is produced with no potential but these decay fully shortly thereafter
		* Activation is the primrary cause of incomplete annihilation, A Mu-Re annihilation is the only complete annihilation possible. Re-Re annihilations wil always produce a child Manakaora, and a Mu-Mu tends to produce either a child or a zero-potential depending on the harmony. 
		* Harmony describes if the potential is attractive or repellent for like charges, this seems to share a lot of properties with angular momentum and some diviners suggest that model is more useful. The sticky and Polished harmony are described as states 1 and 2 respectively. Polished harmony is repellent and has a higher potential but in re-negative configurations, is barely divinable, we suspect Polished-Re-negative (2r-) is what most divination magic works in anyway. Sort of like trying to see glass in the human-visible light spectrum. 1m annihilations produce zero-potential children which decay somewhat quickly, producing two bursts of Mana. One for the initial half-annhilation, the other burst for the full decay. This is interestingly how nearly every magic spell starts with the only tested exception being true strike, and we have no idea why
	* The fey world is made up of Manakaora instead of Atoms, As far as we can tell, the plane is a positive harmony on the prime material, which causes some interesting features that, not by coincidence, loosely correspond to our perceptions of them. This is true as well for the shadowfell, which appears to be a lower harmonic, which dampens many interactions at the effect of being significantly more stable
	* Zooming out quite a bit to a more macroscopic level, The fey are driven by memetic potential, differences in entropy that, like nearly all systems, causes things to change. Nearly all interactions with the fey themselves operate on a basis of trading favours. To the fey, trading favours has the same impact as trading mass in the prime material. We do it nearly constatnly but to do it in the wrong way, such as cutting off a leg can be disastrous. 
	* In this regard, giving a fey your word, interpreted in a rather reasonable way, means that they are able to *take* the relevant composition of Manakaora. On the prime material plane, Manakaora are incredibly stable without magic, it is nearly impossible to move them with the given forces. In the feywild it is about as easy as saying it. Similarly and because of that difference, a denizen of the prime material plane can simply use their own forces to generate manakaora, not unlike making a small whirlpool in water, also about as simple as saying it. This abundance means that creatures of the prime material plane can communicate in favours, while the creatures in the feywild communicate by moving Manakaora. Where Manakaora intersect with the prime material plane, they are what many would call "real". 
	* A fey can thus make concepts intersect with reality by moving manakaora that correlate to those concepts. A fey or any denizen of the feywild can simply make a house should it wish to but the substance of that house is about as fragile as a human promise. It might break and disintegrate as if it was never there with the slightest and most arbitrary forces if effort is not put in against those forces. clothing might disappear in sunlight, a house might disappear in the presence of silver, etc; To the fey this is an understandble mistake or a reasonable outcome, if annoying, but to Material folks, this can be higly detrimental or lethal, or on occasion embarassing. This is the same as not following through on a favour to the fey, which can have disasterous effects on them
	* Archfey that understand these processes may move to the prime material plane to constuct their arts, as they find quite suddenly that with the effort that they are used to using to shape and trade favours, they can simply do some things themselves, such as pick a colour, which is still taxing but far less than it would be within the feywild.
