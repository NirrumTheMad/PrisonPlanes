====== Dwallat ======
Created Wednesday 30 August 2023

===== Description =====
	Large sandstone mesa occupies the centre of the table lands in the western kavir-e-namak. The only paths to dwallat are through a labyrinth of difficult crags, hosting their own special blend of hostility. These crags have made it impossible to siege dwallat, and even the dwarves are loathe to attempt to dig through the crumbly sedimentary rock underneath, so uncharacteristic of the rest of the plane. This is the home of Ujira, King of all of snarl's dragons, **5854: Nope, there's a war among the dragons. **
