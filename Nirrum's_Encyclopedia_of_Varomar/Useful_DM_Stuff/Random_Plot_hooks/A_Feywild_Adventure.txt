====== A Feywild Adventure ======
Created Wednesday 13 October 2021

The party, whether by sleeping in a fairy ring, Following a fey creature around a turn they could not see, slipping through a door under a bed, or by some other means have entered the  [[Feywild]]

This adventure guarantees losing time in the prime material world, though the amount of time can be shortened by diplomacy instead of action. The price for failing to notice things, or sometimes for just rolling poorly is to lose time, life, and any hope of achieving their goas. The Reward for victory is to  become unbelievably powerful in unheard of ways within dungeons and dragons. It is not wise to run this campaign for people who have time-sensitive things in the prime material plane. In standout cases, adventurers might not even come back together. Players must be informed beforehand that without extremely careful planning, this character will likely have to leave things in their life behind. As a DM, the main item that can undo this dilation are Gamblebrumbus pears.

Their journey will be decided by them but getting out will prove a challenge, and getting out unchanged will be impossible

True conflict: Bolstered by Furi funding, a Konian wizard from Morwerta seeks to learn how to create Antimagic Amulets, like the ones used by the Trussari, and to give them to the cult of Changelings in order for them to locate one of the bone artifacts, A small amulet made from one of the small bones of the ear, that allows one to revist thoughts, which in turn will allow them to crack open other bones faster, in exchange for destroying the Manaharahi town of Ardeo. The final boss of this will be a multi-powered warlock-like caster


Recommended items:
	A magnifying glass

Visible conflict: A lost party must find a way to leave the feywild.
	A well known-passage out of the feywild, The one at Gunenmu Sillowdar, has recently closed. The other, more dangerous route lies in  Chal-Ad, the old castle of the summer fey.

The Map
	 Every two days of travel in a straight line without a guide, flip a coin (or roll 1d2). If there has been any deviation, do this sometime during the third day of travel. If the result is the same for three days in a row, they end up in the same region that they started in. These regions are made for the summer, they will change wildly between each season

==== take 3 ====
	Start at level 3
	The party finds themselves in the feywild one at a time and meet up in order. 
		The person with the most items
		The person in need of the most combat protection (Sorcerer, Wizard, etc;)
		A remaining person least likely to be a good defense
		and finally, the person who is most likely to be a good defence. 
	Unfortunately, the person most likely to be a good defense is in combat when they find them. The others enter on the second round of initiative
		the person is fighting a slightly beefy dracoon, in that it axiomatically takes four attacks of any quality to kill
	The party begins to take stock of their surroundings.
	The party begins to travel down what might be called a road if one were mythically generous. 
	The first thing the party finds themselves in a ticking forest. 
		Along their path, there is a wooly beast that has just moved into place, ready to drop on them.
	Travelling further into the forest, they will hear voices, and at a certain point, see a giant standing above the hieght of the trees, only to stoop down shortly after they spot it. As they progress it becomes obvious that they've come across a town [[..\..\..\Feywild\Adventuring_In_The_Feywild\Municipalities\Shildeerintin.txt|Shildeerintin]]
		while in Shildeerintin they can get answers to questions such as
			"Where are we" - Shildeerintin!

			Sidequest that completes after the campaign: Deliver some chalk to an abused child. Taking on this quest decrements your owed favour by 1690, Completing it extends the life of every member in the party by that many days, unless they are in the feywild when it completes, in which case they come back 1690 days later than they would have.  Failing to complete this quest results in fey trying to recoup 1690 favour from you until the debt is payed.
		Delivering a small child named **Raja Wallshatter, **A gold dragonborn who doesn't seem to emotionally react to much. from Caldrona Canyon into the hands of a  Kholirahi General named **Kobet'a** **Shalyssa, **who is quite kind, though unwilling to discuss politics with those who aren't in a position of political or military power.

				**An Acorn. **Shortly after leaving this area, a tiny baby fey emerges, proclaims itself Shewilladima, and tells the party to call her The Modwila at all times so she can keep her name, and shows the party immense love. 
					Shewilladima knows her favour belongs to the party, but she does not have much. she can grant a total of 19,341 favour, after which time, she will perish.
