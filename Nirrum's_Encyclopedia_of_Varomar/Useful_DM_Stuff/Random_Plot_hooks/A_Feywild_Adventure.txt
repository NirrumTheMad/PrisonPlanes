====== A Feywild Adventure ======
Created Wednesday 13 October 2021

The party, whether by sleeping in a fairy ring, Following a fey creature around a turn they could not see, slipping through a door under a bed, or by some other means have entered the  [[Feywild]]

This adventure guarantees losing time in the prime material world, though the amount of time can be shortened by diplomacy instead of action. The price for failing to notice things, or sometimes for just rolling poorly is to lose time, life, and any hope of achieving their goas. The Reward for victory is to  become unbelievably powerful in unheard of ways within dungeons and dragons. It is not wise to run this campaign for people who have time-sensitive things in the prime material plane. In standout cases, adventurers might not even come back together. Players must be informed beforehand that without extremely careful planning, this character will likely have to leave things in their life behind. As a DM, the main item that can undo this dilation are Gamblebrumbus pears.

Their journey will be decided by them but getting out will prove a challenge, and getting out unchanged will be impossible

True conflict: Bolstered by Furi funding, a Konian wizard from Morwerta seeks to learn how to create Antimagic Amulets, like the ones used by the Trussari, and to give them to the cult of Changelings in order for them to locate one of the bone artifacts, A small amulet made from one of the small bones of the ear, that allows one to revist thoughts, which in turn will allow them to crack open other bones faster, in exchange for destroying the Manaharahi town of Ardeo. The final boss of this will be a multi-powered warlock-like caster


Recommended items:
	A magnifying glass

Visible conflict: A lost party must find a way to leave the feywild.
