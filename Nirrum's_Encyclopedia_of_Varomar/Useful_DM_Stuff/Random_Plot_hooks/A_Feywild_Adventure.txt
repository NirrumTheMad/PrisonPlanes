====== A Feywild Adventure ======
Created Wednesday 13 October 2021

The party, whether by sleeping in a fairy ring, Following a fey creature around a turn they could not see, slipping through a door under a bed, or by some other means have entered the  [[Feywild]]

This adventure guarantees losing time in the prime material world, though the amount of time can be shortened by diplomacy instead of action. The price for failing to notice things, or sometimes for just rolling poorly is to lose time, life, and any hope of achieving their goas. The Reward for victory is to  become unbelievably powerful in unheard of ways within dungeons and dragons. It is not wise to run this campaign for people who have time-sensitive things in the prime material plane. In standout cases, adventurers might not even come back together. Players must be informed beforehand that without extremely careful planning, this character will likely have to leave things in their life behind. As a DM, the main item that can undo this dilation are Gamblebrumbus pears.

Their journey will be decided by them but getting out will prove a challenge, and getting out unchanged will be impossible

True conflict: Bolstered by Furi funding, a Konian wizard from Morwerta seeks to learn how to create Antimagic Amulets, like the ones used by the Trussari, and to give them to the cult of Changelings in order for them to locate one of the bone artifacts, A small amulet made from one of the small bones of the ear, that allows one to revist thoughts, which in turn will allow them to crack open other bones faster, in exchange for destroying the Manaharahi town of Ardeo. The final boss of this will be a multi-powered warlock-like caster


Recommended items:
	A magnifying glass

Visible conflict: A lost party must find a way to leave the feywild.
	A well known-passage out of the feywild, The one at Gunenmu Sillowdar, has recently closed. The other, more dangerous route lies in  Chal-Ad, the old castle of the summer fey.

The Map
	 Every two days of travel in a straight line without a guide, flip a coin (or roll 1d2). If there has been any deviation, do this sometime during the third day of travel. If the result is the same for three days in a row, they end up in the same region that they started in. These regions are made for the summer, they will change wildly between each season

==== take 3 ====
	Start at level 3
	The party finds themselves in the feywild one at a time and meet up in order. 
		The person with the most items
		The person in need of the most combat protection (Sorcerer, Wizard, etc;)
		A remaining person least likely to be a good defense
		and finally, the person who is most likely to be a good defence. 
	Unfortunately, the person most likely to be a good defense is in combat when they find them. The others enter on the second round of initiative
		the person is fighting a slightly beefy dracoon, in that it axiomatically takes four successful attacks of any quality to kill
	The party begins to take stock of their surroundings.
	The party begins to travel down what might be called a road if one were mythically generous. 
	The first thing the party finds themselves in a ticking forest. 
		Along their path, there is a wooly beast that has just moved into place, ready to drop on them.
	Travelling further into the forest, they will hear voices, and at a certain point, see a giant standing above the hieght of the trees, only to stoop down shortly after they spot it. As they progress it becomes obvious that they've come across a town [[..\..\..\Feywild\Adventuring_In_The_Feywild\Municipalities\Shildeerintin.txt|Shildeerintin]]
		while in Shildeerintin they can get answers to questions such as
			"Where are we" - Shildeerintin!
			"What world are we in" - The Fey Lands!
			and vague answers to questions about how favour works, without explaining the effects. A fey does not understand the concept of an incomplete favour, nor does a fey understand the human ability to just //do// things. They freely talk about courtly politics.
			While none of the fey there know how to get out of the feywild, questions about mechanics and what is their form of magic are the domain of the court of Lore, which is based in The Clockwork Castle. 
			Some of the whispers fey are deeply excited about the party being in the feywild and ask questions like
				"Will you be staying long?"
				"Have you any Idea where you're going?"
				And they burst out into laughter regardless of the answer. 
		They are able to bargain freely with favour, equal to their level squared times 10
		The following sidequests are available, the favour you get from them is not listed:
			**Valourboard:**
				Kill a wooly beast outside of the town (rewards 40 favour) (automatically completes paper disappears and magic goes into the person who got the killing blow)
				Recover a Royal Mimic Aggrocoral alive (rewards 1000 favour)
				Deliver a garcrystal to Jucagacon Dal Ri (rewards 4410 favour)
			**Whispermonger**
				Place a silver sewing needle inside one of the smaller houses without being seen (rewards 1/8th of a  favour and 250 favour)
				
		The Terror speaker tells of clear weather, unsheltered from the raw magic of the sun, but given a large favour, will warn that the straight line of their journey is tangled in the plots of others.
			The Nearest town is Runewood (which does indeed happen to be on the way to Jucagacon Dal Ri)
		
		**The Local Cheap Swordguide **is a fey goblin whose voice sounds like a full church choir when they speak, they are referred to as "The Mumenahn". The Mumenahn often stops to whisper to plants, declaring that many of them are dreamhooks or similar mechanisms, through which mortals and materials dream. Any favour is worth his services.
		
		If the party elects to wander, roll on the adjacent regions tables and let them wander until something cool happens.
		If the party follows the threads and heads toward Jucagacon Dal Ri, Continue reading.
		
		The party passes through Five regions. The third one, regardless of starting region becomes Underfey halfway through.The players cannot really notice for a while, unless they explicitly look up at the sky and notice the increasingly green tinge (Perception wisdom, DC17). The change is heralded by glass rain, which can be collected as ball bearings in relatively unlimited number. (a bag of holding can hold approximately 94000 such things). The marbles hurt when they fall but deal no damage. As the party is investigating the glass cieling, looking for walls (which are surprisingly close), a roar comes from deeper in the underfey, as well as a chime. Staring at the party, very unimpressed or at least unreadable, is a Belling cat, who takes off dashing if the party gets closer. The band of glass makes way, rather suddenly to doors, at first stuck in the glass, then wood with some bands of glass, then just hallways of wood and doors, into a set of corridorways. A culldersnatch descends behind the party after they make their first turn in the corridoorways and attempts to devour and eat at least one. 
			**Getting Separated.** If a character or characters get lost in the corridorways, take them aside. In exchange for guiding them out a very small lore fey called "**The Change**" asks for a favour, which they redeem immediately. One item they own that is important to them changes physical form permanently, as do their memories of that item to match its new form, justifying all inconsistencies. A harp might change into a horn, a sword into an (equally statted) axe. Alternately, some physical feature about them changes, they do not get to pick what it is, but things like hair, preference in foods, or eye colour might change. Other people do not have the memory of them or the object altered, and proof of the object before the change remains unaltered.
		The Corridoorways are not long, and either by luck or by guidance, they emerge unscathed through a bulkhead door  in the side of a gargantuan beech tree, which is budding with pumpkins. They continue through the next two areas as normal before coming across runewood.
		
		**Runewood.** Mostly intended to be a stopover site. 
			Someone attempts to buy the garcrystal for 50 gold
			A Green Dragon attacks and is taken on by the green knights who dive out of the tallest trees to attack it. The party is rewarded with a free meal if they help
			Runewood is significantly more clear on rules for dealing with the fey and people within it can give precise answers
			People in Runewood are able to give them directions to a few of the ways out of the feywild
				Fairy rings are one of the more common though they have been exceedingly rare this past day
				Plane shift is the most reliable, but no one in runewood can cast it and most of the archfey can only cast it on themselves
				There's an old portal in the old court of the summer if you can find it, as it is hidden somewhere only revealed by the midnight.

			Sidequest that completes after the campaign: Deliver some chalk to an abused child. Taking on this quest decrements your owed favour by 1690, Completing it extends the life of every member in the party by that many days, unless they are in the feywild when it completes, in which case they come back 1690 days later than they would have.  Failing to complete this quest results in fey trying to recoup 1690 favour from you until the debt is payed.

				**An Acorn. **Shortly after leaving this area, a tiny baby fey emerges, proclaims itself Shewilladima, and tells the party to call her The Modwila at all times so she can keep her name, and shows the party immense love. 
					Shewilladima knows her favour belongs to the party, but she does not have much. she can grant a total of 19,341 favour, after which time, she will perish.
					Shewilladima is a member of the court of Valour. She is courageous but not suicidal. She has other ambitions, such as becoming big enough to hold a sword or even use a bow.
					She will sacrifice herself wether the party wants her to or not if they are going to lose something they love when they exit the feywild.
					She will help the party as best she can but she is CR 0. She will hide if there is danger and try to protect things important to the party if she can. She has a lift strength of 10lb

				**A tiny vampiric Mimic that disguises as a compass and tries to bite non-fey that it gets close to. It cannot get through thick leather and needs blood once every two days. More and it will grow, less and it will die.**
