**A content warning is strictly necessary, They fey are psychologically themed, and among them are elements of horror, including many uncomfortable topics and realities. Gore, Sexuality, Bugs, Personal responsibility, Old age, the inevitable march of time, secrets you wish had stayed forgotten as well as some that could not be, Inadequacy, Dysphoria, and the idea that the worst monsters look just like you and that perhaps the thought that one such monster IS you are all things that come up. If you're not willing to face yourself, don't come into the feywild.**


Heading to the feywild is an intrinsically dangerous endeavour.  The very nature of it is different from the prime material plane. Light is Metaphor, sound is allegaory. The experience of being in the feywild is, despite all appearances and with only one exception, not like being in the prime material plane. There are millions of rules that are so intuitively sensical but fundamentally different than what the prime material plane has, it would be impossible to list them all. Thankfully there's a fundamental superstructure that is not impossible to parse. While you will get yourself in sticky situations in the fey, knowing one's own powers and this superstructure will help you

===== Geographic (and physical) consistency =====
There is a myth that there are no maps of the feywild. There is also a myth that there is a map of the feywild. Neither of these are true. Rather, while maps of the feywild exist, they can't be printed like normal maps because normal paper lacks the ability to convey the context of even the smallest portions of the feywild in a reasonable sense.

The feywild is divide into two semi-repeating portions, to start with. The Feylight and the Feydark. Conveniently, the feydark is both to the west and east of the feylight,  and vice-versa. Not unlike day and night here, one comes after the other, but described in distance instead of time. Moving north or south will have strange effects including sharp changes in relative facing direction of approximately 116.57 degrees (these actually occur travelling east to west as well, but as long as you have a heading you can track it relative to the light, but eventually you will reach positions where, depending on the position of your feet, the sun will either be completely inaccessible or completely unavoidable, seeming to be in either no direction or every direction at once. If you stay away from these poles,  you'll always be able to know where you are, with a period of roughly one feywild day per 2.802 planar lengths. 
	//Nirrum's note: I've figured it out. Take a tube and fill it with 12 sided dice that are white on top and black on bottom but kinda diagonally. It's that. You're travelling through the tube from the middle. I really wish my meter stick would work in there so I could get the exact planar length value but that wouldn't make sense I guess. You can cross over from link to link at any dawnpoint which would be the 9 face or any duskpoint which is at the 4, almost opposite eachother. Though sometimes you can go from different points... is it a sphere of some sort? They also seem to move so the dawnpoint and duskpoint will move along edges to new vertexes//
	
The Feywild's strongest intersections with the prime material plane overlap roughly (just under) every two feywild hours, and this only loosely and occasionally correlates to the time in the prime material plane, a fact which is tremendously shocking to most fey upon visiting the prime material plane until they figure it out. It does not take much magic to slip in and out of the feywild, per spells such as some forms of misty step, but outside of those contact points, a higher level is necessary.

When travelling in the feywild, keeping that 116.57 degree change in mind is critical. Instead of our delightful 90-180-360 geometry, things in the feywild seem to favour this angle, meaning a circle has just over 466 degrees, though it might seem to be normal from where you are standing. If you fail to take this into account, you will very likely find yourself walking upside down above your comrades, being *technically* on the same level, being pulled in the same direction by gravity (or it's substitute) but having transposed yourself along other axes. For this reason you can confuse many fey by putting them into a torus-shaped room, they will likely keep attempting to turn a lot slower than beings of the prime material plane to maintain their heading along the track. Straight lines on this plane will seem to material planars to be a series of 64 degree turns alternating to the left and right. There seems to be a sort of right-hand chirality so going left and then left will only turn you left but going left and straight will cause you to turn //downwards. //Right and straight will tilt you upwards. The outermost vertices change through as the dawnpoint and duskpoint move.

With this in mind, **It should be clear why without relative reference frames at every step, no map of the feywild would even begin to make sense, despite the fact that they can technically be constructed and give accurate directions.** The gap between context and abstraction does not fit on paper. 

Other interesting notes: 
* By nature of equivalence, the forces that govern a body change drastically on large scales. 


===== Geographic regions and biomes =====
Without attempting to describe their relationships to eachother, the feywild has the following notable regions, sometimes multiple. Most biomes on the prime material also exist in the feywild, but here are some notable new additions

==== The Dragonleaf Rainforests ====
	It turns out that dragonleaf trees flourish in the feywild, preferring the crepuscular regions mostly. Along several levels of one of these crepuscular regions is the dragonleaf rainforest which seems to be made *exclusively* of young dragonleaf trees. Depending on the position of the dawnpoint and duskpoint, they remain there constantly. When the dawnpoint gets to directly overhead, they start their flowering cycle, where they get extremely aggressive. Ones that succeed then leave the dragonleaf rainforest for other parts of the feywild... probably. They definitely leave for somewhere. Within one of these forests, closer to the dayside than the nightside, is the infinite river, which connects to the prime material plane somewhere south of Manaharamu

==== The Puddletops ====
	Along the afternoon and ealy night bands of the feywild, there is a region known as "the puddletops". The puddletops are a series of pools of water which seem to defy gravity, at least for a bit. Water flows from groundwater aquifers and up along aquacles shaped not unlike tree trunks and into a canopy  of... just floating water.  These pools seldom connect but on occasion they do, and in a few places small rivers can be found flowing uphill. The further upstream one goes, the thicker the trees become. These trees, known as Skypools, house many fish, as well as a relative of the darkmantle that drops down from them, as well as fey Hydra anenomes, which lie in wait with dangling tentacles to pull up things that wander into them.  four legged skimmers run across the tops of these skypools looking for organisms to feed on with their sharp proboscis, but occasionally descend underneath the skypools for safety. The largest skypool is often described as "The size of ten dragons". It is suspected that there is a connection the elemental plane of water at the top. 
	

==== Bouldergarden ====
	The rocks in bouldergarden show every sign of being alive, autotrophic and growing though the growth is extremely slow, even in feywild time. That said, the boulders can be found to grow. What trees grow in this region often have boulders *overgrowing* them. Many of the larger one have fossilized fey who decided to try to make a home inside one, only to find one day that they couldn't get out

==== Mirrorlakes ====
	Dotted around the feywild are mirror lakes, which behave like normal lakes but with some odd features. They are always perfectly reflective, but splashes and drips sound like and behave like broken glass, slowly melting back into the main body after being separated and returning to a smooth surface.  Real aquatic creatures cannot breathe under the surface, but they are not uninhabitted, as the reflections in the pond take a life of their own, and often an adventurer has been spooked after taking a drink and watching their reflection walk off looking unconvinced before they get a chance to do the same. Some lakes seem to allow more than one of the same reflection, others do not. 

==== Wronghouses ====
	Not unlike the bouldergardens except they grow buildings, often ones that can be found in the real world. However, the features of these grown buildings are frequently flawed and sometimes two might combine. A room might not have a door or the door may be too small and way too high off the ground, A window may look into a wall, a rail may be across a hallway. these are signficantly more safe to be in but getting lost  is still easy, this is the feywild after all

==== Storygrass Grasslands ====
	When the wind blows in the wide plains that have storygrass, you can hear whispers, songs, and occasionally stories old and new. The grass is semi-sapient and can communicate but usually isn't spectacularly helpful. 

==== Elephant Sargasso sea ====
	In A few areas in the feywild there are vast oceans of grasses standing over 10 ft tall. The grass is sharp and can cut if you're not wearing clothes but has trouble going through clothing or scales. While the area is navigable on foot, fey eels swim through the grass looking for prey. Other pseudo aquatic life forms live here including Screeching crabs, spritefish (which are like sea horses), and Chaff barnicles. Interestingly also Lucky Tigers (with lucky) and of course, Normal elephants

==== Solid Dunes ====
	Areas of vast desert that are made of solid sandstone. The sandstone still moves in a way that imitates a dune, individual grains swim up through the dune to the lead edge and cement themselves in. A traveller at the leading face might find it begin to grow over their body rather quickly, trapping them and suffocating them unless they can hold their breath until the dune passes, though, most of the dunes are too big for that.
	

==== Rotoscapes ====
	A rotoscape is one of the stranger instances of fey environemtal changes. A landscape underneath the effects of the rotoscape appear to be drawn and redrawn into existence. Lines are grainy and  constrast is high as if done in charcoal or graphite, everything is represented fairly minimally. Eyes on a person may only appear as dots

==== Drayevarg ====
	Occasionally one will find a graveyard in the feywild. Within these places there are an abundance of angel statues which  will never move while you look at them or even rarely move while you're there but can in fact move and often reorganize the place. Things age backwards here, things are born out of the graves and plants age backwards. So do people but it takes a long time. When you enter the Drayevarg, its backward like nature becomes immediately apparent to you, as you will have technically already experienced it
		1) you have to walk backwards in order to proceed though the graveyard
		2) you must learn the few instructions after you leave the graveyard or you will have never been able to get out, and you will find yourself back inside of it.
		3) getting stuck in the graveyard for too long will slowly take away your memory
	Everyone who gets stuck there de-ages but when they de-age fully, the angels set up a new grave, eventually something gets born out of the grave but we're not certain what relation it is to the thing that the grave belongs to. The statues only make new graves on the outside of the Drayevarg, which is how it moves

==== Bladefens ====
	Battle is an important part of the feywild, in places that touch the material plane, the blades of the most passionate warriors might find themselves missing. They usually end up in the feywild in bladefens, catered to by Fey of the Valor and Sword courts. Blades are placed with their hilts in the ground, grasped by buds of red-tipped blue asters that only bloom if the weapon is pulled from the ground.  The fields are guarded each by a member of the courts of Valour and Swords, one to protect the stories of the swords, the other to protect the passion of the warrior that feeds the asters. When someone approaches the  bladefield, they'll be asked to either a duel by one of the fey. The duel can be any form of duel and the fey will attempt to match so long as it is "in the time of  a duel," or at least has minimal prep time. Interestingly the fey *always* lose these duels, at which time the other fey begins a composition to honor them and the winner of the duel is allowed to pick from the bladefen, after which the remaining fey will use a spell to pick all remaining weapons. The unchosen weapons magically disappear and the bladefen blooms fully in bright vibrant blues speckled with iridescent red. The fey that lost the duel invariably dies of their wounds, even if it was a game of cards, chess, or in one recorded instance, a spitting contest. The bladefen can never be visited again by mortals, or at least, one one has found the same one twice.

==== Songgroves ====
	A songgrove is a colony of plants that bear the sounds of instruments. They all play in harmony but they only play in harmony with what they can hear, travelling through a songgrove is a journey through a theme of music.
	

==== Stage Roads ====
	The concept of a road is metaphorical, but in these sunset parts of the sunset feydark that metaphore becomes reality. Spotlight shines constantly on travellers making hiding impossible. The area around stage roads //look// like stages, with risers lifting up out of the ground and showing various forms of pannelled wood, tiled marble, or draping curtains. Each stage has a unique scene on it, with trees growing out of the stage in appropriate ways. While on a stage road, everyone is capable of casting the thaumaturgy cantrip as a bonus action, though the fires never seem to spread.
	

==== Unveiling Woods ====
	Bare-branched trees draped in semi-transparent veils if white. If a thing with flesh walks behind it, it looks like a skeleton to those in front of it. The veils function like Xrays, basically. I'd bet there's some large invertibrate predators there, who take advantage of being basically invisible if behind a veil.
	
	If something is posessed or acting against their will, the thing that is controlling them is shown instead. If the creature is concealed with an illusion, the illusion is stripped away and their true skeleton is shown instead.

==== Painted Rainforest ====
	A place of permanent rain, where the things touched by rain change their colour. Each raindrop is one colour, so you'll get a lot of stripes of colour. Originally I thought, the rain takes on the colour of the thing it first hits and then "paints" It everywhere else it goes, dripping down until it hits the ground. Thick trees 
	maybe trees produce the rain

==== Iridescent Woods ====
	Light shines, things at certain angles reflect only one colour

==== Tiny Techtonic valley ====
	These palces are long, predominantly flat valleys filled with dried cracked mud. These pieces of caked mud shift and move and crash together like shifting landmasses, where they meet, tiny volcanoes form and the ground jiggles with miniature earthquakes. Fires caused by these volcanoes remain proportionately sized and a wayward adventurer may take minutes to notice the conflagration if it has gotten onto their clothes.  It is wise to douse onesself in one of the five ponds at the end of the valley upon exiting to prevent this, or if you're travelling the other way, the large one at the end. Strangely these valleys appear to be shaped like a gargantuan humanoid foot, miles long.
	

==== Serpent's Caves ====
	Throughout many regions around the feywild, tunnels bored deep into the rocks and hills migh become serpent's caves. In the darkest parts of these caves, glowing blue ribbons hang from the ceiling above blue pools of water. These blue ribbons are  cyclomorphic, and grow slowly until they touch the pool of water. There they become an axolotl-like creature with six eyes and green or brown stripes and spots along a blue body.  Here they feed on bugs and occasionally pixies until the pool dries up. When the pools dry up, all of the cyclomorphic axolotls become normal mundane snakes that scatter through the fewild, occasionally ending up on other planes. If a creature ever gets bitten by ones of these snakes, they'll find themselves frequently ill and compelled to travel in the direction of the nearest portal to the feywild, and from there, they are compelled to find a cave, usually the cave the snake had originally come from. There, the person experiences violent vomitting. Part of their vomit will be a light blue ooze that crawls out of their vomit and up the wall  where it cements itself and begins slowly growing a new ribbon. If a ribbon touches the ground without  touching the water, it will transform directly into a snake. If an ooze is removed before it reaches a snake cave, it will attempt to find the nearest suitable cave and begin a new cycle there. To date, no one has devised a method by which to tell which snakes are cyclomorphic and which ones are entirely mundane
	

==== Starfly fields ====
	In the deepest of the midnight plains of the feywild, were even darkvision can see nothing without *some* form of light,  one might find wide, grassy fields amongst the common woodland of the feywild. In these fields, starflies perform their beuatiful dance in order to mate. When they are mature, a starfly will light up using bioluminescent glands, not unlike fireflies. The brightest starfly in the area becomes the center of attention, and other starflies will begin to orbit them in lazy ellipses and circles, trying to get their attention. This has the effect of looking like planets orbiting a star. Lesser flies may attempt to circle other flies in the system, becoming "moons" of a sort but often if two flies get too close without deciding to mate, they will fling off from eachother and disrupt their place in the system. Predatory Comet bugs may zip along a sharp ellipse around the brightest starfly, picking off the weakest but never going for the brighter ones. Because they orbit the brightest light, adventurers may find themselves the centre of attention themselves. A campfire or the light cantrip can easily gather the entire field, creating a bright starfly galaxy.  The starflies work with apparent luminosity and once they find a mate, they drop out of the system and onto the grass to lay their eggs.

==== Firehearts ====
	Occasionally, the forces that compose the feywild combine with catacylsmic releases of energy. Usually a fireheart volcano is part of this. A solid mountain of mostly clear glass, or at least something very like glass, clear enough at least to see the warm glow of the lava at its core. There are two types of Firehearts, faceted and frosted, with Facetted ones giving off stunning light patterns and the frosted ones giving a diffuse glow. Whenever lava is thrown or flows from one of these, it will always harden into a frosted or faceted crystal, making for superior orbs for wizards. Sometmes, fey are born in firehearts, either from the crystal tephra or from the heart of the volcano itself. Fey born of the crystals might be indistinguishable from other fey save for their glassy composition. Fey born from the heart of the lava are always powerful. 

==== Seafog ====
	Along coastal locations, particularly rocky ones, folk may find the air suddenly very thick and hard to breathe as fog rolls in. What were rocks may open to be anenomes or barnacles, and coming in with the fog may be many fantastical skyfish. A decent athletics check will allow a person to fly, but be warned, the fog can roll out quickly.

==== The Underfey ====
	There is apparently an underdark in the feywild.
