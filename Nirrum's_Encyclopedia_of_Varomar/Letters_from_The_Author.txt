Just as Simarillion was built out of notes on tolkien's desk, so too am //I // so terribly organized that half my lore appears in chats and messages. This is an ongoing updated list of such lore.

==== On Eldritch blast ====

		blues19/04/2019
		nirrum i have few questions of various levels of importance
		NirrumTheMad19/04/2019
		?
		blues19/04/2019
		just some flavour stuff and about the circus a few of us want to set up in game
		NirrumTheMad19/04/2019
		go on
		blues19/04/2019
		flavour stuff first how detailed can a EB be and would you like me to send you the description before hand?
		NirrumTheMad19/04/2019
		The eldritch blast is meant to illustrate the free-formness of magic and its flavours in this world. hypothetically one could be firing the three-dimensional equivalents of the Mandelbrot set at people, but for the sake of time, trying to keep it to one line is important


==== On Escaping blackwater, the world at large ====
	blues19/04/2019
	cool
	and on to the circus, will the group that wants to do this be able to once the castle is finished head toward Manaharamu performing on the way? am just worried we might be causing you more problems doing this as well as being unable to level and such
	NirrumTheMad19/04/2019
	You should be able to but it is a lot of work
	Right now I'm working on the Danzuishanese maze some more, I've only got five floors done and I don't want to let those players down either. 
	
	I'm going to need to adjust my levelling scheme but you guys should still be able to level up
	One thing I do ask is to do research before going places. Now that this world is about to open up, I'm not pulling punches on some of the things you may encounter on your journey. Prepare well and  understand the nature of the things you're getting into or travelling across
	blues19/04/2019
	yeah am fully prepared to do research about areas we are heading to before as well as planning this whole road trip out
	and i am sorry if this cause lot more work for you its just that all of us had so much fun making up that escape show when we joked about a circus we all went that sounds like fun
	NirrumTheMad19/04/2019
	And that part is fine
	The work is trying to make it work for you
	there are not many towns or settlements on this plane at all, the spaces in between are filled with monsters
	If you had taken a wrong turn in the chasm room, you would have reached the underground ocean, which is more or less just deep horrors, surrounded by insidious underdark
	If you had gone overland and to the north gate you would have run into Demogorgon and his army of pixies and sprites. If you had gone overland and south,  it would have been werewolves, giant spiders, and a very long journey
	east is dragons, Kholirahi scouts, and all of the nasties of the woods
	North is its own can of worms too. 
	This world was built to be accessible but it is a violent and terrible place outside of the cities,
	NirrumTheMad19/04/2019
	bandits are a transitory concept, the sort of thing that clears itself up within a year or two
	blues19/04/2019
	interesting
	NirrumTheMad19/04/2019
	Manaharamu has its army of mages, Danzuishan has Three dragons and an army of dragonborne, Kara'ite has the best defenses money can buy, Dwallat has secrets I will not spill, Konia had the best martial army on the plane until recent, and Kholira is filled with high-level druids. Skalmirthon is inside of an active volcano and has one of the most culturally-siege resistant people in the multiverse living alongside some of the best assassins and the sneakiest sappers.  Blackwater had a temple to the god of death, Ninjas, and Three level 5 Npcs in it. 
	
	Small towns like pebblerpony have high concentrations of magical defenses, while others make themselves inaccessible or, indeed, are just lucky.
	
	What it takes to be a carnival, travelling across the land is determination and wit, and no small amount of plotting and planning
	NirrumTheMad19/04/2019
	You want to venture to manaharamu overland? First you must cross either the upper gannaga,or the slopes of the aegis mountains,  One , a densely forested rivercourse, the other an inhospitable snow-blasted mountain range. You might make it to Xia Ochiko or Stalwark, one a backwater shantytown on a river, the other a Military Stratocracy, filled with griffin riders and people who fight against the kholirahi without much help from the triad.  Then one way or another, you must cross the great grass road south, A field of intense flashfires, and three unique indigenous groups. 1) Broomb's Band, 2) Greetu, 3) Ramishi. Orcs, Gnolls, and Halfling horseback archers respectively. One of these groups is anywhere near tolerant of strangers.
	
	THEN and only then do you get to make it to the gates of Manaharamu, on the slopes of the Mohara range, A cold and deeply spiritual mountain with a warm and deeply friendly people living halfway into the desert at its base. To entertain these people, who have grown up knowing magic as sure as their hands, what do you have to offer?
	I encourage you to try, to change the face of this world and to become the concept you envision, but you must do planning of your own
	Interestingly, should you have enough water, the great grass road is made almost entirely of the finest barley, wheat, and corn.
	The Xia river is filled with delicious fish and surrounded by cherry, serviceberry,  and plum trees
	The slopes of the mountain covered in goats, ligonberry, and sphagnum bogs that hide blueberry and cloudberry

	NirrumTheMad19/04/2019

	Into an Enchanting Forest || Magical Celtic Music @432Hz || Mystic...
	
	This world is a world of duality. I filled it, still fill it as I go with the idea of bounty coming first, and the wilderness coming after. With tight communities spread far apart. The ambitions of the cleverest villain amount to little more than a clever escape. The Machinations of its darkest corners are those chaotic reaches of the unintelligent an uninformed as they attempt to dive into a world that is far over their head. 
	
	Acererak, The most famous lich in D&D can be found in grand tortuga in underport, staring in awe at the shores of the underground ocean because as he was travelling the cosmos as a demilich, something slapped the physical body back onto him
	He stares in shock and awe at powers that dwarf the grandest schemes he has ever concocted. Gods fall and are born with every breath of this plane. The connectedness and disconnectedness, A thrumming harmonic, an ellipse whose epicenters are polar opposites. Where life is worse than death, But Death too is worse than life. Where you can find untold bounty, treasure and power if you don't die to those who found them first, Where the most successful civilizations were made by the staunchest resolve of the strongest people to have them succeed. Where every creature on this plane was banished, exiled, torn away from their home or descended from someone who was. Where the failure to move forward is met with certain death but every step in a direction is met with the tug of someone who thinks forward is a different way
	The blood of the strongest heroes, direst villains, and second cleverest wizards from across the multiverse, their culture, their teachings all smashed into eachother, making a strong people with the desire and ability to accomplish things


==== Air Travel in 5852 ====
	blues20/04/2019
	Nirrum what ways to travel across the prison plane are there? And yes am planning this out (on the bus home after work)
	NirrumTheMad20/04/2019
	Overland, underground, air, teleportation circle
	blues20/04/2019
	How easy is air and teleportation circle?
	NirrumTheMad20/04/2019
	AIr is only recently easier, The Griffon riders of stalwark along make travel around the aegis a breeze if you're not Kholira or they don't want to seize your goods for the war effort
	Teleportation circle has issues, mostly extreme tolls for use and a high barrier to entry.
	blues20/04/2019
	Ah ok. So is possible to get an airship from Skalmirthon?
	NirrumTheMad20/04/2019
	It will be in about 1 year
	4 days into your stay the king left to get to Manaharamu on foot with some other adventurers. about two months later he makes it and a year later he will return to skalmirthon and issue sweeping reforms that generally just copy manaharamu, preventing the decay of a resource-based economy
	at which point skalmirthon starts making airships
	Danzuishan, Manaharamu, and Kholira are the only nations which produce the big ones, but the models that aren't using less dense gasses like hot air, helium, or hydrogen, are using an alchemical floating stone which is only sourceable from grand tortuga of all places
	Ship Macleodquin, IIRC
	blues20/04/2019
	But this does give me some idea of how long over ground travel takes and makes planning travel abit easier
	So is there airships from stalwark?
	NirrumTheMad20/04/2019
	Not many
	They use griffons
	blues20/04/2019
	Ah ok and yes am will to do all the research rolls for this info
	I will even spend a month in game time planning this
	NirrumTheMad20/04/2019
	good because the last party ran into an ancient black dragon like, a week south of Mjoriskivor


==== On road trips ====
	blues20/04/2019
	Oh
	So glad am smart enough to not do stupid stuff
	Is there anything else I need to know before I start planning this rather insane road trip?
	NirrumTheMad20/04/2019
	Don't look at the moon
	blues20/04/2019
	Why!?
	NirrumTheMad20/04/2019
	It is a bad idea
	Broombs band sings to try and make it go away. It does not work
	
	blues24/04/2019
	not sure if this is info i will be able to get without making in game rolls but i need to ask, how difficult would it be to cross the slopes of the aegis mountains? also how much would a large tent for a circus, stuff for tightrope walking and chairs cost?
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	There are only two convenient passes and then the coast roads
	Mjoriskivor and stalwark
	blues24/04/2019
	am trying to work out how difficult it would be to get to stalwark fortress and if it would be worth going that path  manaharamu
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	better to take the south highway to mjoriskivor which would lead to your settlement as well
	Then take the Xia river  to the grass road. If you can organize a ramishi escort beforehand then you'll be safer from orcs, gnolls, and dragons
	blues24/04/2019
	ok, where would we be able to organize an escort? Mjoriskivor or Xia Ochiko?
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	You'd have to find a way to send a messsage ahead of time, either with a caravan that's heading out or via magic
	blues24/04/2019
	alright now the big question is how much will an escort cost?
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	If you can afford a grand, you get the "warband", but the ramishi are easy to haggle with
	There's a few rolls to be made to know how to haggle with them
	blues24/04/2019
	alright then
	also how much would a large tent for a circus, stuff for tightrope walking and chairs cost?
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	Three ring?
	blues24/04/2019
	hmm not that big maybe a tent big enough for a single ring?
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	gimme a bit to do some research on the history of waterproofing but so far for getting the tent top and the poles it's about 60g. sides will be calculated in a second
	blues24/04/2019
	thank you
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	sorry, wrong chat
	blues24/04/2019
	its alright
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	200g for a 2 ring which you'll need for the tightrope
	blues24/04/2019
	is that with the poles?
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	yeah, Aldrin made the right choice in picking the area, which isn't far removed from redwood forests and in general has long straight conifers just to the east
	blues24/04/2019
	alright then this gives me a good idea of how much this trip will set me back and hey at least we will have all the wood we need
	will it be safe to say the elephant has enough carry strength to carry all that in a wagon?
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	easily
	blues24/04/2019
	just had to check
	and we have some horses and a carriage to carry the party around
	so looks like this will only put a dent in my wallet, which am ok with given this was my idea
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	indeeeed
	blues24/04/2019
	do you want me to remove the money from my character sheet now or leave it for tomorrow?
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	now's fine
	blues24/04/2019
	alright i will make a note that i spent my money on all this
	blues24/04/2019
	how much would it cost to send a magic message to the ramishi to let inform them that we are coming and would like to hire a warband for an escort?
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	90 gold to purchase a  message to the right people
	blues24/04/2019
	alright
	and would i know where i would be meeting said warband to discus hiring them?
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	almost directly north of Manaharamu there is an bend in the river that comes close, they will attempt to meet you there
	blues24/04/2019
	am getting close to two pages of notes just for the traveling
	can i spend my money now and send the message so tomorrow i can just turn to everyone and say "oh dont worry i sorted it all out"?
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	Indeed
	blues24/04/2019
	sweet
	NirrumTheMad24/04/2019
	though it'll take about a week after leaving mjoriskivor to get the tent ready
	blues24/04/2019
	so just spend one week around the castle as we get the tent ready to go?
	so we have the equipment for the circus being made, we have sent word a head to the ramishi to let them know and we have the path for the trip planned. i believe that is everything sorted
	

==== On Silk ====
	blues03/05/2019
	Nirrum in the week before we leave the castle would I be able to get two outfits tailored made?
	NirrumTheMad03/05/2019
	Youd have to take a few days to get to Mjoriskivor to find a good tailor, but they'd be able to whip up some suits in the run of two hours each
	Good ones too, fine silks from Ardeo, Gold thread from Skalmirthon, Red dye from  Welton, very nice, you buy you buy!
	

==== On the Ramishi and Haggling ====
	blues07/05/2019
	nirrum you said the ramishi are easy to haggle, in what way? would i be able to get there price down by like 50% or could i pay them with something else?
	NirrumTheMad07/05/2019
	;D you'll have to ask them
	blues07/05/2019
	Damn it, I was hoping to get some info so I could plan it
	I was thinking I could hire them for the castle or something
	
//The Ramishi simply ask for double and expect to be haggled down, they'll sign on any number above their price.//

==== Xia Ochiko and the Role of Gods ====
	blues14/05/2019
	nirrum for my side character am making a gloom stalker ranger inspired by the dark templar of starcraft, i was wondering if you could tell me anything about the shifters in the prison plan? as its one of the two races am torn between for this character
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	The only major shifter population IIRC is in Xia Ochiko. They've got not much to their name other than that the inventor of the battery is from there. There was another batch that lived in Konia but....
	As a rule, they tend to survive well, their relationship with the wilden is probably the only reason a town made of wood could reasonably survive for more than a century.  They, the fey-like guardians of nature are dryads, tied to the Primal spirits. To be honest, there shouldn't be any wilden on Snarl but yet they somehow have formed here,  Entirely native. They and the shifters manage to keep eachother safe with quite the thematic combination of Animal and Plant based defenses
	blues14/05/2019
	oh thats pretty cool
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	The wilden obviously take to being druids, not unlike their neighbourly firbolg off the edge of the Skal, the shifters live much more peasantly lives, but fighters and rangers tend to rise from their ranks
	especially the goat ones
	they get a goddamned climb speed
	blues14/05/2019
	goat shifters?
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	Dunno if it's in the Current version of the race but back in 4e there were like, eight subraces and they boiled down to "has claws, Can breathe underwater, has a climb speed" and the like
	blues14/05/2019
	ah ok thats why i dont know them
	the current version has Beasthide, Longtooth, Swiftstride and Wildhunt
	any interesting cultural infomation i might need?
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	>.> Not yet, still hammering that out, Xia Ochiko only really has a small amount from my older DMing days
	I'm working on updating all of the older spaces to my new standards
	The entire length of Skalmirthon's document should be the standard length for a barbarian camp
	blues14/05/2019
	good god
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	They do gold panning at least, and the fishing is abundant. They don't have room or really resources for a foundry so with the gold, all they can do is cart concentrates down to Danzuishan
	They also have three clerics on hand, none of which have names yet, but sylvanus at least is well-liked here
	"### Urban:
	The town is small, home to less than a thousand individuals in its highest peak, but usually only 400 or so tend to stay. While it is not as small as some hamlets along the Steppe, it pales in comparison to the large cities. The buildings tend to be wood, turned grey by the humidity, though they are often decorated with colored cloth. The water is clean enough to drink from but more importantly there are a few clerics, two of pelor, one of sylvanus, on hand to cure any cholera or other illnesses and help the wounded. There is no formal government, though council is called when problems need to be addressed. This has worked out well for the most part, though bad and manipulative leaders are common in such a system. They are not particularly isolationist as they profit greatly on trade."
	blues14/05/2019
	Alright
	blues14/05/2019
	are there any other natureish gods that people in that area follow?
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	Pelor, Mielikki
	blues14/05/2019
	am guessing Eilistraee would be a odd one for someone of Xia Ochiko to follow
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	very
	blues14/05/2019
	fair enough
	blues14/05/2019
	if someone was a follower of hers what would the people of Xia Ochiko do?
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	Not much, honestly. The dominant worldview on this plane is that the people are valuable and that the gods must compete for them
	There was a time in history when there was the knowledge of more gods than people
	blues14/05/2019
	ok then, good to know
	i know in alot of setting someone like Eilistraee would get you in trouble
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	heh
	Those are the settings where the gods are feared
	The gods in this setting gotta do work
	
	blues24/05/2019
	is it bad that i want to tell the queen of manaharamu about Xia's dyes?
	NirrumTheMad24/05/2019
	That's where they get their blue and purple dies from
	it's Xia Ochiko's main export
	blues24/05/2019
	i am not going to tell her that my party has jumped the price of it up then
	NirrumTheMad24/05/2019
	probably best
	the queen herself doesn't mind but the merchants around town  would be furious
	The college of glamor would be mildly annoyed too
	
	
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	I love the ramishi
	blues31/05/2019
	they are interesting people
	the two small groups of people the group has meet have been alot of fun to be around
	everyone in the circus crew wants to go back to Xia as soon as we can
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	XD that was one of the better moments in my campaigns ever honestly
	blues31/05/2019
	honestly thats great to hear, i love that little place
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	It wouldn't have worked if you weren't the circus crew
	Xia Ochiko was a boring stop-over for the previous group
	blues31/05/2019
	that really does show how different groups interreact with the same things differently
	it was one hell of a blast
	blues31/05/2019
	the mindset the elder had was also very interesting
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	heh
	I try to keep these places diverse
	blues31/05/2019
	it makes it more fun
	in know mana is going to be fun to run around in and i am expecting grand tortuga to be hell a fun
	but xia ochiko i feel will be my favourite place in the plane
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	one of those little slices of heaven
	Green, brown, grey
	shocks of orange and blue for the people
	blues31/05/2019
	i do hope one day another party visits xia the same time we did our show
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	unfortunately, this campaign will be the last to start in 5851
	blues31/05/2019
	aww shame, no one will ever see the great show
	out of interest what year will the future campaigns begin in?
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	Alas, I can't say, mostly because I haven't decided
	not too far into the future,  5854 is a hell of a year but this campaign will continue beyond that
	
	

==== On committing Diplomacy in Manaharamu ====
	blues14/05/2019
	hey i just had an idea, if i set up a tavern in mana could i use it as a second base?
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	ye
	blues14/05/2019
	cool thats what am going to do
	at least in mana it should be safe
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	:thumbsup_tone5:
	blues14/05/2019
	For future reference, who in mana would I need to talk to about that? I already have the head of the college of glamour, nirrum the mad and the Queen of mana on my list
	blues
	 pinned a message to this channel. 
	See all the pins.
	14/05/2019
	blues14/05/2019
	damn hand not work right now
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	I feel that
	You'd need to Apply for citizenship (not hard to obtain), then find a building for rent or sale, purchase those rights, then apply for a permit
	blues14/05/2019
	So I would not be able to set one up as a diplomat?
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	You'd be better off setting up an embassy there
	then use that as a contact for a business
	blues14/05/2019
	Now I like that idea
	How does one go about setting up an embassy?
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	You'd have to talk to the queen, maybe even the king of skalmirthon and then work that out from there
	blues14/05/2019
	Good thing I asked to speak with the king when I get to mana
	And so glad I got that fancy outfit
	Ok so I got my plan for when I get to mana now
	Unless the gods kill me first
	Get the doctor strange cloak, speak to the king or nirrum then the other, speak to the queen then speak to the college of glamour.
	
	Be warned when I get to mana I will be doing alot of research on the queen and how to act around her
	NirrumTheMad14/05/2019
	I think you personally are going to love her
	blues14/05/2019
	Oh I hope so and I can not wait to meet her now
	
	blues17/05/2019
	i...........i ok am going to try and be a good person in this world
	also i know i might of do something really bad for the world but i have had a really silly idea
	would i be able to have a friendly duel with the queen of mana?
	NirrumTheMad17/05/2019
	no
	extremely inadvisable to suggest
	even if she accepted, that'd be the sort of thing that gets people stabbed in dark alleyways regardless of the outcome.
	blues17/05/2019
	awww, she sounds like the type that would be super into it
	NirrumTheMad17/05/2019
	possibly!
	blues17/05/2019
	so if i could have it be in total secret it would be ok?
	NirrumTheMad17/05/2019
	I cannot answer that question
	blues17/05/2019
	cool, now to find out how to set it up in secret and to have the duel in secret
	
	blues22/05/2019
	out of interest how easy is it to have a meeting with the queen of mana?
	NirrumTheMad22/05/2019
	It is not!
	slightly harder than a meeting with the queen of england
	which is to say, they lock the front door
	blues22/05/2019
	what if am on a diplomatic mission?
	NirrumTheMad22/05/2019
	They might unlock the door
	so fairly easy then
	blues22/05/2019
	perfect, now to hope kaiser remembered to sort out the paper work
	now the real question, how hard is she to make friends with?
	NirrumTheMad22/05/2019
	;D a good question
	blues22/05/2019
	i swear i will do everything to befriend her because you already sold me on her as a person
	i also think it would be fun to go back to the castle going "hey guys this is my new friend the queen of mana, say hi guys"
	NirrumTheMad22/05/2019
	She gets along really well with just about anyone that's half decent with emotions
	The people who are less in-tune with emotions such as the king of skalmirthon she might butt heads with.
	blues22/05/2019
	hmm so she likes sane people?
	NirrumTheMad22/05/2019
	I wouldn't go that far. She doesn't like people who hinge poltical ideas on Good ol' Facts'n'logic^tm
	
	In her eyes much of the axiomatic theory behind things get in the way of their function. Which, to be fair, makes her a better ruler than the local mages who kinda...forget that the rest of the town is there
	She's not dumb, but she doesn't subscribe to the reductionist worldview of most members of the university,
	blues22/05/2019
	oh she does sound interesting, i think i will enjoy her
	still want a friendly duel with her
	NirrumTheMad22/05/2019
	The university as a whole and as a rule is very much "this happens because of this"
	blues22/05/2019
	interesting
	NirrumTheMad22/05/2019
	Context and study areas notwithstanding of course. You can get by in nearly every course with only a basic understanding of the magical theory that it entails and only tangential links to related spells
	blues22/05/2019
	hmm, i feel branwen will do fine in mana
	NirrumTheMad22/05/2019
	Most people do Fine in Manaharamu, it's a relatively sane place
	blues22/05/2019
	oh i just meant because of her skills and the fact she can now do magic
	NirrumTheMad22/05/2019
	Magic is good! Not having magic is seen as kinda....
	a handicap
	blues22/05/2019
	so most of my party is viewed as handicapped in mana?
	NirrumTheMad22/05/2019
	Handicapped in multiple ways! To start with, they are adventurers
	blues22/05/2019
	yay am not the cripple of the group anymore
	NirrumTheMad22/05/2019
	taparmishi is a slur
	blues23/05/2019
	Now this is a mad question, seeing athe current King of Skalmirthon go the job through murder how would one go about becoming a member of the mana Royal family?
	NirrumTheMad23/05/2019
	Marriage, diplomacy, and not getting figured out by the queen
	she hates ulterior motives, especially when they involve her family.
	blues23/05/2019
	Am really starting to like this queen, I guess she also likes honesty
	NirrumTheMad23/05/2019
	Yep
	The next line that follows that she hates is how she hates. The answer is violently
	
	

==== On bone artifacts 1 ====
	blues17/05/2019
	Nirrum I had an idea I want to check, the femur the wizard pulled out and the plate did they have markings like the one on the jaw bone under Blackwater or did they give off the same energy? (one good thing about my job it let's me think about this stuff)
	NirrumTheMad17/05/2019
	different energy, same material though
	both potent
	blues17/05/2019
	Ok, hmmm I will use my time meditating and learning to warlock to talk to the shadar kai about the jaw bone under blackwater
	NirrumTheMad17/05/2019
	He is there to instruct you on the use of your warlock powers, not to divulge secrets, too many have been lead astray by hubris and the promises of power
	blues17/05/2019
	Fair enough, looks like I have to do the research solo
	I am worried the plate and femur both hold a piece of ternua like the jaw bone but looks like I need to find the answers another way
	NirrumTheMad17/05/2019
	the two ultrapowerful artifacts made out of white porous material?
	blues17/05/2019
	Yes
	NirrumTheMad17/05/2019
	I think that would be prudent to research
	blues17/05/2019
	Yeah, I plan to just need to work out where to start
	Long shot but would I know if manaharamu would have anything that might help guide me on this?
	NirrumTheMad17/05/2019
	's a good bet
	blues19/05/2019
	also what skill would knowledge on teruna and the bones be? arcana, history or religion?
	NirrumTheMad19/05/2019
	history but it's an extremely obscure history
	
	blues23/06/2019
	good point
	hmm possibly a very stupid question, what would happen if two or more bones holding teruna got caught in a fireball?
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	Nothinf
	Nothing at all
	blues23/06/2019
	so they would not break?
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	8000 years and you don't think that nothing like that would have happened?
	blues23/06/2019
	i dont know one broke under blackwater
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	;D context


==== On the University of Manaharamu, Manaharahi culture ====
	//Some of the information in the post is outdated. The School of Enchantment now handles therapy because otherwise the school wouldn't serve much purpose. I also mispelled Thoub a lot//
	
	blues24/05/2019
	question about the university of Manahamaru. with the nature of enchantment magic and stuff like detect thoughts does it have some form of mental support for students and staff?
	NirrumTheMad24/05/2019
	could you clarify?
	blues24/05/2019
	for example my uni had a mental health team, just in case people need help dealing with personal issues or stuff along the lines of depression
	would the uni of mana have something similar?
	NirrumTheMad24/05/2019
	Indeed, though as per their healthcare system it's usually done by higher-level wizards or artificers.
	
	An important thing that people forget is that the Temples in Manaharamu all double as something else. Llira's is a hostel, Moradin's is a forge, and Oghma's  is the artificery, which also doubles as a hospital. While it's not as robust as our modern systems can be, counselling and a few well-placed spells tends to do the trick
	there are always some who slip through the cracks of course
	blues24/05/2019
	that is good to know, so would it be possible for a student to join there mental health team? (willing to bet it has a special name)
	NirrumTheMad24/05/2019
	The Medica is the term for that side of the artificery
	mental and physical health are bundled together because with magic, such ailments are equally obvious
	blues24/05/2019
	interesting, i thought about this when i was making the stats for the npc and looking at the wizard schools and it made me think Enchantment magic can be used to really people if in the right hands
	NirrumTheMad24/05/2019
	Remember I don't need stats, I need the RP block
	unless you're just making a regular character
	blues24/05/2019
	oh no making a npc i just did the stats because i use dndbeyond so it took me like two seconds do them
	NirrumTheMad24/05/2019
	heh
	blues24/05/2019
	due you know what the more casual cloths of Manahamaru is?
	NirrumTheMad24/05/2019
	thobe
	thobes for days
	blues24/05/2019
	its that hot down there?
	NirrumTheMad24/05/2019
	Desert Canada
	Based largely on Qatar
	blues24/05/2019
	ah ok then
	because i know some cultures did this and some still do, do the colours of the thobes mean anything?
	NirrumTheMad24/05/2019
	Not particularly in Manaharamu, though I might look into that
	blues24/05/2019
	I cant remember if any Arabic nations did it but for the longest time in alot of places purple was the colour of royalty
	
	blues23/06/2019
	nirrum out of interest has anyone in mana every tried to mass produce transmutation stones?
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	yes
	blues23/06/2019
	did it work?
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	Unfortunately a wizard can only make one at a time
	so they have a solution
	blues23/06/2019
	oh
	clones
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	Transmutation wizards in the university have a great and honored duty. To take items of lesser value and reduce them into other spellcrafting components. Frequently this produces the diamonds needed in resurrection rituals. Only Wizards of the 14th level or higher can achieve this and it is considered the most valuable thing that the university does. For this they are granted a place in the University's scroll of Progress, inscribed therein are all those who contributed significantly to the field of magical study. The Scroll of progress is also a standing list of people to resurrect if shit hits the fan. This duty has the added effect of stabilizing the economy on the plane, being largely responsible for the lack of inflation on the plane despite the constant influx of people, goods, and high-value treasures. The use of these components in spells also helps ammend the occasional antimagic field by flooding the plane with large amount of excess unused mana. The lead-glass cap is a testament to this, as it reflects octarine exceptionally well, and stands as a beacon to casters to remind them that knowledge comes at a price, and it is our duty to keep paying it. It effectively glows in magical light, eclipsing the sunny shine of the gold upon which it stands. Knowledge trumps physical wealth, and if it doesn't look pretty to you, then you probably don't belong here.
	the last bit is describing the gold tower of transmutation which has a lead-glass point
	blues23/06/2019
	ok
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	ah, I just missed the first paragraph entire
	Considered the pinnacle of Magic's usefulness, The school of Transmutation brings in may of the university's students and a fair chunk of its income. It is housed in a golden tower, first to contain the occasionally apocalyptic magic that originates from therein, but also as a display of the University's prowess. The tower stands at 36 meters tall and is capped with a piece of brownish lead-glass. The tower is the tallest building in Manaharamu from its base, though the castle sits higher uphill and the Power plant is on top of the mountain.
	blues23/06/2019
	damn
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	I think you would have loved the head of the department of Transmutation
	blues23/06/2019
	oh?
	so far your guess on me have been spot on so tell me more about the head of the department of transmutation?
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	XD
	The School of Transmutation is mastered by:
		She-of-iron-nests  (Wizard 18) (ENTJish)
			A sapient, Enterprising, and powerful swarm of wasps with many queens to whom the world is putty
			None of these other stats matter as they are highly variable
			Age: The oldest Queen is currently 2 years of age, though, is that really a good measure? The phenomenon is just over 3000 years old
		She-of-Iron-Nests is an anomaly, Born in Tepet during the height of the city's power, The wasps that compose her are constantly casting transmutation magic on the entire colony to not only awaken but control it. This cycle of control cannot even seem to be broken by antimagic fields as it is so tightly woven, much as one might find on an artifact. She-of-iron-nests thinks in alien patterns and uses parts of the nest that compose her to cast spells. She usually sends a golem, one of her queens or any organism nearby that she might awaken to do her work for her, and spends her time doing deep philosophical research while yet learning to truly control the true world. She deeply enjoys the company of All of the other Masters except perhaps Metwiki. Her Lust for knowledge is countered only by her ambition and constant existential pondering
	blues23/06/2019
	i have always wanted to ask a question like that
	that is both amazing and creepy all at once
	i love it
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	slightly inaccurate, she was born in Mana Ulla, not tepet
	blues23/06/2019
	i need to drag the party to meet this person(?)
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	She Identifies as a person yes
	She is in part a reference to Aunt Hilary from Douglas Hofstadter's Godel Escher Bach
	Who is a sapient ant hill
	blues23/06/2019
	damn
	i am going to have so much fun meeting everyone in mana

	blues18/07/2019
	isnt it illegal to charm people in mana?
	NirrumTheMad18/07/2019
	EXTREMELY
	
	blues25/01/2020
	am trying to work out how a megacity in a fairly magical setting would handle waste
	NirrumTheMad25/01/2020
	Manaharamu sends druids to collect it
	it may be one of the reasons Druids were allowed into the university at all
	blues25/01/2020
	oh yeah druids would make good use of the waste
	NirrumTheMad25/01/2020
	Not only does this mean that Manaharamu is able to increase its food stability through druid enrollment from mage-wannabes without the aptitude to be wizards or the like, but it also means that they don't need to have a cesspit outside of town
	Manaharamu doesn't have much of a natural water source. It technically does have a freshwater spring but it's not nearly enough to sustain the population as it is, the water tends to be generated magically, but even with this magic, it doesn't have enough to run a proper sewer. Most civilizations will build on a river or near enough to a water supply that they can aqueduct in and run a sewer on wastewater and effluent from industry
	A gelatinous cube can work but you have to make sure you kill its offspring
	blues25/01/2020
	so guards or the never ending number of adventures would be sent down to deal with it?
	NirrumTheMad25/01/2020
	Guards. Why would you ever depend on adventurers?
	blues25/01/2020
	true
	NirrumTheMad25/01/2020
	you're just as likely to end up with a new criminal underworld that's powered by your own sewage disposal system then
	blues25/01/2020
	very very true
	

==== The Arts and Amphitheaters in Manaharamu ====

	blues24/05/2019
	i imagen based on what you said about the queen she would be going "hey you made that village better"
	the college i need to talk to about setting up a theatre?
	NirrumTheMad24/05/2019
	"need"
	The college isn't in charge of the arts, just influential
	blues24/05/2019
	who is?
	NirrumTheMad24/05/2019
	No one? The amphitheatres are public use and events must be run through the council  ahead of time. You might be competing with most churches for the hour-wide slots but they tend to do their worship during the day
	only a few religions worship at night
	blues24/05/2019
	so we could do the classic circus and theatre thing of having our shows late at night?
	NirrumTheMad24/05/2019
	ye


==== On War, The Kholirahi, and the state of politics between the major nations ====
	blues31/05/2019
	due to me rewatching colville's videos on politics and war in d&d i have been left with a few questions about your setting the first and biggest one, why did Kholira attack blackwater and go to war with Skalmirthon?
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	XD GOOD
	GOOD
	Finally the right questions
	The Kholirahi Godking, unlike the statesmen before him, wants to lift his people to the stars, and wants to bring everyone with him
	But the dwarves have refused outright to even consider it
	Really though, blackwater was also historically Kholira's territory
	It was their first stronghold during the year of darkness, the castle and some of the tunnels were their work
	blues31/05/2019
	does that include the sealed tunnel?
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	That was even newer stonework
	Truth be told Valalen made that tunnel
	blues31/05/2019
	thats impressive and makes sense with how creepy it was
	back on track so the Kholirahi attacked because of the pride they had for there first stronghold and wanted it back but also Self-Interest of the godking's goal of lifting his people to the stars?
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	Along with control of the ushlubarel river basin, a stronghold to the south, access to more food production, easier trade through the ushlubarel rather than going through the northern ocean
	It's also worth noting that Skalmirthon was militarily weak at the time, they were kingless, corrupt, and directionless
	blues31/05/2019
	with a new king that means its possible for Skalmirthon to grow stronger militarily wise
	and i believe the creation of the blackwater crater has thrown a wrench in Kholirahi plans for now
	my next question is why have they not gone war to with Manaharamu yet?
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	Fight manaharau? What, float up a river that doesn't exist with their boats? Fight an army of mages in the air?
	The real reason is that Konia's Navy is still entirely intact and quite competent
	blues31/05/2019
	so basically they don't want to deal with fantasy British navy?
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	More or less
	Konia was unable to defend against Manaharamu but they've lasted for literal millenia despite being Magically averse
	blues31/05/2019
	interesting
	this is just me thinking but if i was the godking of the Kholirahi i would try and take Skalmirthon as then i could use the tunnels they have to get pass the mountains which in turn would give my land units a path to manaharau and with Skalmirthon out the way i would be able to in circle stalwart
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	you make it seem as if the tunnels aren't available to everyone already
	There are reasons to not crowd the depths
	blues31/05/2019
	based on my limited information
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	Heh
	blues31/05/2019
	but still removal of Skalmirthon would give them a rather long path to Manaharamu
	like i said just me thinking and maybe trying to predict the future events of something that has been planned out for years by a mad war gamers
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	heh
	Fighting the most siege resistant people on the plane is perhaps not the best idea
	Look how that faired for Monteblanca and the Sunstorm Crown
	blues31/05/2019
	that is true
	NirrumTheMad31/05/2019
	Then again, fighting anyone on this plane is a bad idea, they are all survivors

	blues01/06/2019
	I have been thinking about the questions I asked yesterday, I know the reasons why the kholirahi attacked but what was the thing that keept the peace?
	NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
	XD airships
	Declaring war without  airships would have been suicide
	blues01/06/2019
	fair enough
	so next question why is the three kingdoms in the big trade deal at peace?
	NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
	;D a good question. While Manaharamu can't invade the other two, it has an excellent strongarm on trade
	Manaharamu wants Danzuishan to be up and running around the Maze and skalmirthon is cheap labour
	blues01/06/2019
	and the other two dont have fire power to say no?
	NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
	Not even close
	and Manaharamu's magic items exports are still extremely useful
	ditto their electrical engineering
	blues01/06/2019
	so if a new power shows up in oh say the middle of them its will throw a wrench in this peaceful deal?
	NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
	eh, you'd have to set up manufacturing for the exports manaharamu has
	Fridges, single-stroke motors, and of course, magical items
	blues01/06/2019
	i was thinking more on the line of a group that is trading in food, tea and other such things along with gathering up a large number of levelled characters
	
	Jormungandr11/07/2019
	Essentially, she's prodding for a place to put the manor XD But also I'm curious about the state of the Kholirahi invasion
	NirrumTheMad11/07/2019
	They vacate an area once they've raided
	They don't like spreading out their forces
	
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	How far do the Kholirahi really reach? Because there's that big empty spot in the middle that they've been reaching into towards Blackwater and I'm wondering how much of an uncontrolled corridor past there is still left
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	The Kholirahi forces only barely establish footholds in the places they conquer because of how dangerous the plane can be, even for them
	They hit, enslave, retreat
	and in this case they're almost entirely sticking to the river
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Huh. What do they even want, if they aren't really holding it very well
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	the people
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Oh yeah. Slaves
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	People are the treasure of this plane
	In a landscape netted with gold and adamant, crawling with monsters of all types
	the only thing really worth anything is people, and the Godking has plans
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Another thing. WHO is the godking??
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	Moseie, the Godking of Kholira
	He is described as having blue skin, Orange eyes, black hair, 180cm, white roots running through his skin, carries around a staff which we're nigh certain has an actual star contained on the top
	14th godking of the Kholirahi

		Welcome to the cult and service of zuggtmoy
		blues01/06/2019
		am going to the biggest temple in the city
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		that'd be The Artificery
		blues01/06/2019
		How much to fix this?
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		ehhhhhhhhhhh
		Working on that
		one way or another you're stuck like that for at least a session
		blues01/06/2019

		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		8D that was possibly the worst thing I have ever seen in all my years of DMing
		I'm delighted to figure out what it takes to fix, I know at least one option but that's a hell of a walk
		blues01/06/2019
		greater Restoration?
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		Gonna be real, I don't think Greater restoration fixes this
		blues01/06/2019
		oh shit
		would the temples know how to fix this?
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		:smile: I have no idea
		blues01/06/2019
		so glad i have that head band and cloak
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		:smile: the real question is, do you have the headband and cloak, or does Zuggtmoy
		blues01/06/2019
		what?
		can i retcon licking the blood?
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019

		"Most of zuggtmoy's cultists are hapless mortals that have been infested with the demoinc spores she cultivates in the fungi she created. The spores slowly devour these creature's brains leaving them with enough functionality to spread the malevolent fungi but robbing them of the will to turn against their master"
		blues01/06/2019
		so if we are fast enough it wont be to bad?
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		wellll it won't get worse
		blues01/06/2019
		if we fix it do our stats go back to normal?
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		:smile: you'll need to get both greater restoration and regeneration if it progresses at all
		blues01/06/2019
		so if we are fast enough we can fix it easier?
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		8D yes
		I do hope fargrim picks up on it
		blues01/06/2019
		we are not telling him
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		:smile: I know
		8D zuggtmoy wouldn't allow that
		blues01/06/2019
		am going to the temple
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		wisdom saves will need to be made
		but not now
		next session
		blues01/06/2019
		fair

		Civil Serpent
		Warp Survival 101 with Leman Russ, Step 1: "DRINK THE WOLFIN CHAOS!"

		blues01/06/2019
		nirrum be honest
		on a scale of 1 to 10 how bad is this?cult
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		Oh I'm having a splendid time
		I have to write an actual quest
		blues01/06/2019
		i know you are
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		but licking cult blood off of a cult chalice off a cult altar in a cult temple dungeon tomb when surrounded by demons of Granny Zuggs the Mushroom queen is 10/10 the worst Idea I've ever heard of
		:smile: I'm delighted you had it
		blues01/06/2019
		great
		i hope the raven queen noticed this
		are branwen and brandy going to have to go on there own quest to fix this?
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
		well
		not necessarily on their own
		but you'll have to fix this in person
		blues01/06/2019
		as in, in game or in person with said evil demon?
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		in game and as your character doing a thing
		no phone calls to Activated Charcoal auntie
		blues01/06/2019
		i hope you mean the raven queen
		i dont want to be the person that activated a demon
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		I can't think of any other Activated charcoal aunties
		Granny Zuggs is distinctly fungal
		blues01/06/2019
		fair enough
		question does this mean i can not call on the raven queen at all until this is fixed?
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		:smile: to make things easy, I'm gonna say, the RQ is unable to take your call at this time, please call back during lower traffic hours
		blues01/06/2019
		i have about 50 swears for this
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		how delightfully representative
		blues01/06/2019
		so next question does this mean the only person i can talk to about this is brandy because she is infected as well?
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		:smile: yep
		if you keep it for a week, you get the suggestion spell!
		blues01/06/2019
		ast
		i dont want to keep it a week
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		:smile: that's good
		blues01/06/2019
		well that tells me i can fix this in aweek
		i hope this quest will be fun
		and am worried its going to be limited to a two man party
		blues01/06/2019
		You know what am now praying this quest will be insanely fun
		if my character dies i want it to be a fun story at least
		question nirrum if its spores can a doctor remove them?
		blues01/06/2019
		out of interest how badly does this effect my ability to talk with people that is not brandy?
		also i hope you tell rys about this i think he would find it funny
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		:smile: PERHAPS

		blues01/06/2019
		no joke as everyone else is trying to work out what to do me and jorm and thinking about running away to fix it ourselves
		blues01/06/2019
		Well nirrum this is going to be eating at me for the rest of the week
		So I can't wait to play
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		Couldn't have made a better hook myself
		blues01/06/2019
		Am glad I made you such a good hook
		blues01/06/2019
		How quickly will I notice the bad stuff?
		Also would I off gotten my new magic items before licking the bad cup?
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		nnnnnnnnope
		You guys have yet to enter the city
		blues01/06/2019
		... Shit
		So am stuck at 9 int
		For now
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		:smile: only slightly below average
		blues01/06/2019
		Look I need that smarts
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
		:smile: right?
		blues01/06/2019
		I mean how else am I going to fix this?
		NirrumTheMad01/06/2019
<ADVENTURE TIME IMAGE>
blues01/06/2019
Yep
And see being dumber means the plan me and jörm have come up with is perfect

that sentence warms my heart
blues01/06/2019
Am going to have fun with this and the madness no matter what


	When trying to get an antimagic amulet from the Mafia
		blues14/08/2019
		how so?
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		Well you're definitely not antimagic
		Lemme get the effect
		blues14/08/2019
		oh boy
		i need to stop getting cursed. i have to be setting a record at this rate
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		Yeah, I'm not gonna like, there's a large chunk of Umlil orill that's been turned into enemy assets
		blues14/08/2019
		is that because of mind control?
		or because of me ?
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		Oh that's a secret
		blues14/08/2019
		fair
		am totally not going to have sending cast to find out what happened
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		You won't be able to know, unfortunately
		blues14/08/2019
		fair enough
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		There's no real way for your character to get that information
		blues14/08/2019
		wow
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		so what's up is that you're under a bit of a mix of Modify memory and Dominate person, The short of it is that you're a Furi Sleeper agent
		blues14/08/2019
		fuck
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		yep
		And the amulet doesn't come off, needs remove curse
		at least
		blues14/08/2019
		i need to stop getting cursed
		at least this one is fixable
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		Ehhh, there's not really a way for you to communicate the change to anyone
		fixable yes, Detectable, less yes, The amulet is under the effect of Nystul's Magic Aura
		blues14/08/2019
		great
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		yep
		:thumbsup_tone5:  Dealing with the Mafia only ever works if it's a win for the mafia, they're not the sort to go for "mutually beneficial"
		and you revealed yourself as an important piece in a foreign government and that that government was explicitly allied with one of their worst enemies
		blues14/08/2019
		fair enough
		the upsides are i now have a free counter spell and a possible ally
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		actually doesn't work
		blues14/08/2019
		...
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		:thumbsup_tone5: Gino straight lied
		blues14/08/2019
		...
		i got played hard
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		You think this is bad, if it was my brother DMing the entire party would be blackmailed six ways to sunday and umlil orill would already be a shithole
		When we fought the Thirteen eyes....UGH
		blues14/08/2019
		this is fixable
		if i say it enough times it becomes true
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		This is true, it is fixable
		blues14/08/2019
		i just need to work out how to get it fixed without telling anyone?
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		but you're gonna be instructed to give that other amulet to someone at some point, and I'm not going to tell you that it's got  the same curse
		but like, you didn't check
		blues14/08/2019
		if i know am cursed am going to get it check out
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		you are going to be instructed not to
		blues14/08/2019
		this bitch does not play around
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		She does not, She's also one of the nicer members of the Furi
		The fact of the matter is, it's not just working out how to fix this, as far as Branwen is concerned, this is fixed. The Furi are the people you follow now.
		I'm not a fan of mind control, hate it actually
		but I do very much dislike it when people get comfortable
		blues14/08/2019
		noted
		so i now need to work out how to make it so branwen does something that tips people off to the fact she is cursed
		again
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		And alas, there will be no real chance until after the timeskip
		blues14/08/2019
		well i can ever hope the raven queen notices are go through with the single worse idea i have ever had
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		Alas, you forget
		you're her pawn too
		I do believe that is a record yes
		blues14/08/2019
		i hate mind control
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		Me too
		blues14/08/2019
		well the good news is i was planning on getting alot of anti magic amulets
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		"good"
		blues14/08/2019
		i hope they effect this curse
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		The antimagic amulet you were given does not function as an antimagic amulet at all
		That's the hook and the bait
		blues14/08/2019
		i plan on getting two more
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		good
		blues14/08/2019
		one from nirrum the mad if i can
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		He cannot
		blues14/08/2019
		and one from the queen
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		She will not
		blues14/08/2019
		fuck
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		Nirrum doesn't know how to make the antimagic amulets, they're an extremely well kept secret of the trussari guard.
		The Queen of Manaharamu is not a fool, and does not trust anyone outside of the Trussari to have the power to single-handedly stand against Manaharamu
		blues14/08/2019
		fair
		could i ask her for the support of the Truassari in dealing with the wizard?
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		The Commander Tenkitagan must be the one asked
		blues14/08/2019
		please tell me he is in the city
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		Lord General Tenkitagan
		and probably yes, he was visiting a friend in Danzsuishan a month ago
		blues14/08/2019
		can i try to find him?
		who would of thought dealing with the wizard would need this much set up? (other then you)
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		You should see how the other party went about it
		though, you will
		god that'll be heartbreaking
		5854 is a hell of a year
		blues14/08/2019
		great
		when i find him i want to explain the wizard problem and how the raven queen said i had to fix this fuck up
		also am guessing he always has his amulet on so what happens when i stand near him?
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		A random Taparmishi getting an appointment with the Lord General is Unlikely, unfortunately. If this wizard is a threat, they're not a threat to Manaharamu
		blues14/08/2019
		wait
		can i ask deloch to help set up a appointment with the general ?
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		Deloch won't be able to help with that
		He's a foreign power, recent foreign power, and he refuses to hand over control of Skalmirthon to Manaharamu
		blues14/08/2019
		fuck i know there is away to do this
		NirrumTheMad14/08/2019
		There is, but it will have to wait until after the timeskip
		blues14/08/2019
		...
	//It is worth noting this was conveniently resolved on the day of colours by some passing coatl//
	
		NirrumTheMad04/12/2019
		While i'm not gonna start another campaign in 5851, if I did, those players would be hearing about a new duchy in Skalmirthon's foothills that seems to play real nice with monsters, a couple of bits about some taparmishi clowns that came to Manaharamu and decided to buy the biggest airship they could after they lit the Hospital on fire


==== On Immortality ====
	blues07/06/2019
	whats the easiest way to become immortal in the plane?
	NirrumTheMad07/06/2019
	by not dying
	Gonna have to be a bit more specific because like
	being suspended in time is a lot easier than becoming a high level monk or paladin but a lot less freeing
	blues07/06/2019
	how could i make Killmaster a ageless creature?
	NirrumTheMad07/06/2019
	haha, I'd have to look that up myself, but there is a way
	blues07/06/2019
	aren't some people in mana immortal?
	NirrumTheMad07/06/2019
	A few
	but not many
	The oldest person in Manaharamu looks ancient, there are younger immortals than he
	blues07/06/2019
	how easy is to become a vampire?
	NirrumTheMad07/06/2019
	Fairly, just gotta find a vampire, there's a whole family on Grand Tortuga
	the Avisen Clan
	blues07/06/2019
	would there be any problems in doing that?
	NirrumTheMad07/06/2019
	Some, you'd have to barter well but
	I think time will be favourable to that course of action
	also the bone artifacts are a good source of immortality :wink:


==== Gods and the Raven Queen ====
	
	blues08/06/2019
	basiclly part of branwen gaining proficiency in religion will be finding ways someone becomes a god
	NirrumTheMad08/06/2019
	gods are like any life
	find enough energy, flourish in it without perishing
	Fire is too much energy, the inky void of space too little
	blues08/06/2019
	so if you find a great enough source of energy you can become a god. can this source of energy be anything? (with in reason)
	NirrumTheMad08/06/2019
	provided you have a way to channel it
	gotta make sure the pipes don't break
	blues08/06/2019
	based on what people said, having a god help you would be them helping you channel it and maybe giving abit of energy?
	i hope the RQ like the idea of having a helper god
	NirrumTheMad08/06/2019
	You would do well to know her story before asking such a favour
	blues08/06/2019
	i have read both versions of her story
	but i got the feeling she might be different in this setting
	NirrumTheMad08/06/2019
	Her right to be a god was stolen from her by many other gods, and when gods fell in wars between gods, she often swooped by to pick up the pieces
	when the realm of the dead was taken from her and she was left with death, she waited until gods spilled gods blood and stole winter and fate from the fallen
	blues08/06/2019
	so you run of the 4e lore for her cool, i like that version of her more
	NirrumTheMad08/06/2019
	The 5e version does not conflict with it, thankfully
	blues08/06/2019
	my thought for this idea has been that due to the fact that no other gods seem to care about this plane and the RQ is just about able to keep the plane together she could use the help and no matter how strong branwen gets she cant help everyone but if she gets the power of a god she can do far more
	NirrumTheMad08/06/2019
	But in the raven queen's eyes, that power could just as easily be hers, and she'd be far more able to exert control
	blues08/06/2019
	see this is the part where i would want to sit down and talk to her to explain this idea
	because i believe she would find benefit in having another god loyal to her
	NirrumTheMad08/06/2019
	Her ladyship hates hubris
	pride goeth before the fall, and the fall is a lot farther than people give it credit for
	She waits at the bottom, after all
	blues08/06/2019
	i still think i could talk her into like the idea
	
	blues23/06/2019
	am guessing the raven queen knows the insult and is now using it as a warning to her followers?
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	All two of them?
	She has some shadar-kai but they follow her in a looser sense here
	blues23/06/2019
	well 1 that tells me she does know it and 2 i mean Shadar-kai as well as any future followers
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	It will likely spread as they die and are reborn
	blues23/06/2019
	so a endless cycle
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	Her harvesting of their memories before sending them out is so similar to the shades left by the reverie
	blues23/06/2019
	see i love the insult but am praying this is not the only impactful thing my character does
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	I doubt that'll be the end
	blues23/06/2019
	oh i hope
	and hey how many more insults can i create?
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	Many
	
	blues11/07/2019
	i am going to get the bones back will she slap me again when i hand it to her in person?
	NirrumTheMad11/07/2019
	She would be honored at your presence should you manage it
	

==== On ignoring certain rules ====
	blues22/06/2019
	i see why you rip the 5e leads a new one, i was seeing if i could make a belmont style build but i noticed something very annoying turns out you cant take advantage of reach weapons  on cantrips like booming blade or greenflame blade. they have a range of only 5ft
	NirrumTheMad22/06/2019
	huh, deja vu
	blues22/06/2019
	am guessing someone else got annoyed when they noticed this
	NirrumTheMad22/06/2019
	nearly identical conversation I'm just trying to figure out where
	blues22/06/2019
	huh
	NirrumTheMad22/06/2019
	I just ignore that in my games
	otherwise the whip is useless
	blues22/06/2019
	yeah
	well glad to know that,  when i was looking into the belmont build i did notice alot of evil things i can do with a whip on branwen's current build
	i wont tell anyone about the offical rules on those cantrips because i know no one else in the circus crew has noticed it
	

==== On Stat Books ====
	blues23/06/2019
	nirrum out of interest, the stat up from the magic tomes are magic in nature correct?
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	Yes but they become intrinsic, soul-altering effects
	blues23/06/2019
	so any form of anti magic fields wont effect them?
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	Correct
	blues23/06/2019
	ok thats less then good news, that means if i get the wizard in this field he would lose his spells and magic items but not his buffness
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	Combartch is hecka shredded
	blues23/06/2019
	shredded enough that even a swashbuckler would have a hard time 1v1ing them?
	NirrumTheMad23/06/2019
	probably not,
	Though he has some tricks
	blues23/06/2019
	i figured he would, always have a backup plan if your normal tricks dont work anymore and all that


==== On Saint Grace and Knight Lord Garywold, and their ability to party ====
	
	blues11/07/2019
	am also thinking long term because can get some good rituals for staying alive
	next  for the circus stuff, has the crusade army stayed with us as we took the short rest or did they fuck of to kill people?
	NirrumTheMad11/07/2019
	fucked off to kill mindflayers
	blues11/07/2019
	ah shit
	was hoping they would of staying with us so we can all rest but am guessing there are not alot of mindflayers left
	ok last question how did saint Grace react to me basicly going "hey we want to have a victory party later for everyone you two saints in? and can we do something nice for fargrim?"
	NirrumTheMad11/07/2019
	That's going to take her a minute to process
	she's very involved in her wrok
	blues11/07/2019
	thats fair
	NirrumTheMad11/07/2019
	I don't think she quite gets parties
	Her mentor does though
	blues11/07/2019
	if she does not get those i would then ask it to the other saint who i guess is her mentor
	NirrumTheMad11/07/2019
	Garywold is not her mentor
	blues11/07/2019
	ah ok he just comes across as a mentor to a group with the whole "no no dont kill the help, you want to break that wall down dont you?"
	NirrumTheMad11/07/2019
	No, he's just sane
	blues11/07/2019
	god that is funny
	ok i guess she understands the wanting to do something nice for the person that just saved your soul part?
	if not am going to be very worried about this person
	NirrumTheMad11/07/2019
	She's high strung
	Always focused on doing her best for Pelor. I can't go into her backstory much, but she just attributes parties and such as things that other people do
	She can focus on her work knowing that other people know how to party
	and thank people
	blues11/07/2019
	I will talk her into this one party or die trying
	NirrumTheMad11/07/2019
	There's an insight check to be made there but make it in-session
	blues11/07/2019
	Can I make it right at the start?
	NirrumTheMad11/07/2019
	ye
	blues11/07/2019
	Perfect and if my character dies trying to teach a Saint how to party it will be a good death


==== On Magic Items ====
	 it possible to arrange a meeting with the queen of manaharamu?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	It is
	blues07/08/2019
	How would I go about that?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	Submit a diplomatic reason or talk to Deloch if you want to meet with her or make yourself well known during court.
	blues07/08/2019
	Ok I would go with the first option and if that fails I would ask deloch
	blues07/08/2019
	Okay I will figure out what to do with the diplomat stuff later, can I ask around the university for info on the wizard I give the bones to?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	there's not much on him there
	He moved in over the site of a recent earthquake near berpsin, and that's about it
	blues07/08/2019
	Ok that makes it seem like he did not study at mana. Is that correct?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	Doesn't seem so
	blues07/08/2019
	Interesting
	Okay, can i ask the Artificers if they can make a bracelet that holds thieves tools?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	they can indeed though they ask for double the price
	blues07/08/2019
	Double the price of thieves tools?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	ye
	blues07/08/2019
	Ok so 50gp I will pay that, I will now take it out of my total cash
	Ok next question can the archfey of eyes make cloths or amour that is as good as +1 studded leather?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	that'd be +2 clothing
	or rather +3
	so yes
	blues07/08/2019
	How much would that cost me?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	scales as +n armor
	blues07/08/2019
	Ouch that is alot of gp
	Is there a way to get it cheaper?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	not really
	blues07/08/2019
	Damn
	My brain went  "ask for it as a favour"
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	Alas, I have to do work on those favors
	blues07/08/2019
	That's fair also i know its a bad idea
	Am trying to find ways to improve my gear but until I sell all the monster parts I got am short on cash
	Selling magic items is equal to the items cost to buy correct?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	yes
	blues07/08/2019
	I might sell the plus +2 ac and plus +1 initiative because I just remembered I need a free hand to cast magic
	Was it a rare item or a very rare item?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	It should be in xanathars
	blues07/08/2019
	i will check now
	ok i found a shield of +2 should i treat it as that one?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	gimme a second
	A bizmuth bronze buckler
		+ 2 AC (+3 total) + 1 initiative  this is the thing you have
	
	not a +2 shield.
	
	sells for one rarity level higher though
	blues07/08/2019
	ah ok so very rare thank you now to work out if i should sell it or not
	blues07/08/2019
	i might regret this very quickly but am going to sell my shield so i can turn my old raiper into a dancing sword and then buy +1 studded leather. is that alright with you?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	very good
	blues07/08/2019
	is it alright to sell the Sending Stone and Immovable Rod i got?
	NirrumTheMad07/08/2019
	Indeed
	blues07/08/2019
	yay i have money again
	
	
	blues29/01/2020
	nirrum i know you give npc player levels but do you also give them high level magic items?
	NirrumTheMad29/01/2020
	pfffft
	yes
	how else will the players get them?
	blues29/01/2020
	so you would give npcs  legendary or  artifact items?
	NirrumTheMad29/01/2020
	yep
	This is snarl, they don't let that shit sit around if they can help it
	
	Jormungandr03/05/2019
	How much does a bag of holding weigh again?
	*cost
	NirrumTheMad03/05/2019
	cost 3k, weight, 1lb
	Jormungandr03/05/2019
	How big can I make an opening, and can I shove a body inside. Also does the body decompose in there
	NirrumTheMad03/05/2019
	Opening is gonna be at most a foot wide, bodies do decompose while within th ebag
	some of them may end up fermenting if the bag is shut for a long time
	haversack is bigger, about two foot wide and portables holes are about 10ft
	In around the area of 3m
	Jormungandr03/05/2019
	Yikes. How much of the body do you need to resurrect the person?
	NirrumTheMad03/05/2019
	not much
	Jormungandr03/05/2019
	Excellent!
	Time to dig up a body.
	Jormungandr03/05/2019
	Could we get a bag of holding in Skalmirthon?
	NirrumTheMad03/05/2019
	ye
	Jormungandr03/05/2019
	I'm assuming for a resurrection you only need like a hand, or some hair?
	NirrumTheMad03/05/2019
	yeah I'm gonna rule that so long as you have some intact tissue that was once living, such as bone, you're fine
	Teeth, hair, and nails don't really work
	Jormungandr03/05/2019
	Bone is good. Bone doesn't decay.
	So how morbid is it to make some of his bone into a necklace, and claim it's blood hunter shit, so nobody else suspects what the thing is.
	NirrumTheMad03/05/2019
	Extremely!
	do it

	

==== On a certain build ====
	blues15/08/2019
	nirrum you would know this, is the coffeelock build even broken?
	NirrumTheMad15/08/2019
	eh
	it's overpowered, not broken
	blues15/08/2019
	alright, i spoke to someone about the build idea am leaning to and they through a bit of a fit at the idea
	so am trying to work out if the build would be a problem
	NirrumTheMad15/08/2019
	it's like a cracked sink gasket that just dribbles a little when you turn the water on
	blues15/08/2019
	that is the thing i have no interest in using it to get more normal spell slots
	i want to use it for quick and twinned spells
	going to be honest the build i want to make and how i want to use it sounds fun to me but i dont want to make something if its going to tick people off
	NirrumTheMad15/08/2019
	eh, you'll be fine
	blues15/08/2019
	Thank you, I know its possible to abuse the system with this build but I know for a fact I would never do that, I also know am not going to be taking healing spells other then healing word and I have taken pact of the blade so I can't do the full build
	To be safe I will also only do the build if I get the go ahead from a DM
	

==== On cults ====
	blues09/10/2019
	whats the deal with this Changeling cult that follows teruna?
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	:rainbow: You'll have to investigate to get answers about that :rainbow:
	blues09/10/2019
	ok fair, good thing i have a priest that has dealt with them on speed dial
	but let me change the question alittle, were they the cult in skalmirthon?
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	For once, no, That's was a different cult
	blues09/10/2019
	ok that tells me alot more then i expected
	is this cult why Changeling are not trusted on snarl?
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	because of a different cult?
	blues09/10/2019
	the ternua cult
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	No, the reason the changeling cult are not trusted by you and the few people you've talked to about them is because they've witnessed their works firsthand
	blues09/10/2019
	ok that is interesting information, so it would be safe to say they are not really known about ?
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	One might assume that yes
	blues09/10/2019
	ok that makes it sound like there are a few reasons i am missing
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	indeed, there are people to ask, but you need to find them
	There are rumours worth looking about for
	The real question that no one seems to ask is the thing that I will always tell people
	and that's a hint for a riddle
	blues09/10/2019
	how do they get immortality from the bones?
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	Some of the bones just grant immortality but it's worth noting
	the demon does too
	blues09/10/2019
	ok that is fair
	ok, why are they doing this?
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	Immortality
	quite explicitly
	blues09/10/2019
	is that the true reason or the reason they tell people?
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	That's what you've heard
	and been offered at least once
	blues09/10/2019
	i knew it
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	Twice, if you count the wizard as part of the cult but he's
	Just kinda a guy?
	blues09/10/2019
	he is his own thing?
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	Manaharamu probably would have already dealt with him if he were like super evil
//This was a lie. Combartch is one of the highest ranking members of the cult, but Nirrum the Mad, the Character, did not know that.//
	blues09/10/2019
	fair enough..........the guy in blackwater that give trizane the quest was a part of the cult
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	Which guy?
	blues09/10/2019
	the vizier?
	the one that wanted the bone to "protect" blackwater
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	Ah, Domino Izrik,
	A bit of Irrelevant backstory, technically yes
	Domino was actually in the middle of betraying the cult with that move
	blues09/10/2019
	i know we ran into a Changeling during that whole mess............
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	haha, yes, you did indeed. Twice, technically
	blues09/10/2019
	interesting
	i am now trying to remember the other other of immortality i got
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	I believe it was someone at the docks
//Three times, Tulio at the docks, the other was Damien, //
	blues09/10/2019
	hmm ok
	why did the cult offer me immortality?
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	...
	'cause it's a good thing to have
	blues09/10/2019
	thats a interesting reason
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	I mean if someone threatened to kill you, you'd be rather upset
	one assumes that if they do the opposite, one might be quite pleased
	blues09/10/2019
	so they give immortality in hopes it will get people to join them
	is there anyway to tell who is in the cult?
	NirrumTheMad09/10/2019
	Absolutely, many ways
	you know none of them, but I'm sure you can figure some out
	blues09/10/2019
	ok
	

	Jormungandr04/08/2019
	Out of random curiosity, is Teruna a valid Warlock patron option
	
	NirrumTheMad04/08/2019
	If you talk to the right people absolutely
	NirrumTheMad04/08/2019
	Technically it'd be those who seek to free Teruna who teach you how to use warlock-like powers, Teruna's kinda trapped and unlike the other demons isn't spectacularly communicative, but intense study and elbow-rubbing among his cult allows you to access some neat shit


==== Why Snarl Exists as a setting ====
	blues26/12/2019
	they do
	i think of making a monk as my backup character
	NirrumTheMad26/12/2019
	What type?
	and for which campaign because there is actually one other consideration I make that I forgot to mention
	"what does the DM need to tell a good story?"
	blues26/12/2019
	that is true
	i am turn between drunken master, shadow or four elements (i know its super weak but it looks cool)
	am not sure which campaign most likely the snarl one(s?)
	NirrumTheMad26/12/2019
	Snarl is easy because it was purposely made to allow the players to try wild things, very much a beginner's campaign. Well-experienced and practiced players that work together with eachother and the DM and build dramatic moments can accomplish amazing things in mostly railroaded campaigns because of their efficiency
	

==== On Calendars ====
	blues28/01/2020
	nirrum DMing question if you are in the mod to answer, how do you do days in a setting? do you do the lord of rings thing where they say "oh no this is just the english words for the days"
	NirrumTheMad28/01/2020
	Every world has a fairly unique calendar setup. I left mine at 365 days so people could determine their birthdays and project their experiences, and I left a week as 7 just so I could translate a work week better
	but I did make each month 30 days and put a 5-6 day holiday party as the new year
//I also made the first day of spring into the new  year.//

==== Snarl's Powerscale ====
	YouTube
	MrRhexx
	The Single Strongest Named Monster in D&D
	
	NirrumTheMad13/03/2020
	heh I'll watch in a moment when I'm finished typing up this artifact.
	blues13/03/2020
	fair enough also that monster is CR 50
	NirrumTheMad13/03/2020
	huh, that does beat out the prismatic dragons barely
	I think it also beats out almost everything on my plane
	blues13/03/2020
	yeah its pretty insane
	NirrumTheMad13/03/2020
	I think I'm going to power up Mirikius
	side note
	
	heh
	blues13/03/2020
	Yeah turns out that is a thing
	NirrumTheMad13/03/2020
	... I'm looking at that breakdown and I need to update Gono as well
	Gono's a level 11 cleric and an Ancient Blue so
	blues13/03/2020
	I am afraid
	NirrumTheMad13/03/2020
	This just tells me that I was right, Snarl is a higher power tier than most DnD campaigns by far, and it's not even the most OP of the prison planes
	blues13/03/2020
	Yeah I noticed that watching critical role
	The fights we have had in snarl have been well much higher difficulty then the ones I have seen and alot of the npcs seem to be stronger then most bbeg
	NirrumTheMad13/03/2020
	"nyah, I'm vecna I have two ninth-level spell slots"
	soft clapping from like six people on snarl
	blues13/03/2020
	Yeah
	What little I know about the god King puts other bad guys to shame
	NirrumTheMad13/03/2020
	HEH
	blues13/03/2020
	And the fact someone killed the king of the abyss in what two hits? Shows the power difference
	NirrumTheMad13/03/2020
	Guy was only level 14 when he did that too
	blues13/03/2020
	I feel snarl brings out the war gamer in people
	If I did not play in your setting nirrum I would never of started think the way I do about builds
	NirrumTheMad13/03/2020
	XD I remember the first several encounters with you guys, watching you spread your damage out over your enemies like a soft blanket
	

==== On A brewery in Blackwater ====
	Jormungandr14/03/2019
	I'm assuming Brandy has settled in Blackwater, then?
	NirrumTheMad14/03/2019
	Ye, got your brewery
	


==== On broken bones ====
	Jormungandr02/05/2019
	How evil is said escaped evil
	NirrumTheMad02/05/2019
	eldritch abomination that consumes the concept of death itself
	Jormungandr02/05/2019
	Seems nice enough
	How separate is it from the rest?
	NirrumTheMad02/05/2019
	The blackwater portion is Meters away from the main body, pinned to the ground by a magical bolt
	Jormungandr02/05/2019
	Yikes
	NirrumTheMad02/05/2019
	The rest of the pieces are still quite scattered
	Jormungandr02/05/2019
	Is it separate from the rest, or is it... like, part oft eh whole
	As an entitiy with a mind
	NirrumTheMad02/05/2019
	Part of the whole, it has intelligence of its own that ends  up joining the main bit
	Jormungandr02/05/2019
	Hmmm :)
	Jormungandr02/05/2019
	So out of curiosity, can they take human forms? The little pieces?
	NirrumTheMad02/05/2019
	No one really knows, the pieces haven't really been broken before, not that anyone knows
	Jormungandr02/05/2019
	Hmmmmmmmmmm


==== On Dragons ====
	Jormungandr21/05/2019
	Can you pay a dragon. As in, have a dragon join your side as an employee, or a two-way pact. Symbiosis!
	NirrumTheMad21/05/2019
	You can!
	don't worry about that
	Jormungandr21/05/2019
	Oh, why not
	NirrumTheMad21/05/2019
	;D 2583 there's a silver that's looking for a new home
	Jormungandr21/05/2019
	:D
	NirrumTheMad21/05/2019
	don't tell anyone
	Jormungandr21/05/2019
	Come to me, dragonling, I can give you a home
	NirrumTheMad21/05/2019
	"ling"
	
	//Nirrum's note: I'll have you know that Mahi is //**ancient**
	

==== On Combartch T'ct'caeri ====
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	I've been thinking about the wizard's reward, and I kind of know what I want, but also not really. I'm kinda terrified of asking the wrong questions. Honestly, I want to go just for information, but I also anted a way to network/keep in contact, because I always felt given who he is, it'd be nice to have a "back door" unknown to the party. Idk
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	He did offer a chance at immortality
	He can get you contacts, hell, He can get you a whole network of immortality seekers
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	I kinda wanted to network, in case I could offer similar exchanges again, or some such. In general, I thought such a contact would be great. What I actually wanted was information on the nature of the plane though, why it is the way it is, how to get off, why the moon is like that, what the creature under the earth is, that kinda stuff, but as I said, I'm afraid of asking the wrong questions (and I guess wasting my shot, when I could always have just gotten a useful item), though story-wise I feel like he knows a lot, y'know?
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	:smile: you have asked the right person
	You'll have to find time away from the party for him to answer them
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	I may or may not have been agonising about this for actual weeks
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	He knows the answer to every single one of those questions
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	God I need to buy more sending stones. I need a fucking magic telephone
	Magical dialup
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE medup medup BEEEEEE merrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
	MRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
	SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	wheeze
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	dial up was a terrible time
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	Heh
	Given this is something that should have happened ~several weeks ago, how would Brandy be able to actually stay in contact?
	I actually considered buying sending stones in the river village to #call them again
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	Understand that Combartch Tc'tcaeri is very much a person, and is thankful that he got the item he did. He limited you guys to the one magic item because he doesn't have the resources to give out more, He's not nearly as rich as the Mages in the University
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	I mean, if I can get an item AND information, I'll be just as happy, but like, yeah. Not just that, I think he'd be a good, or at least very interesting ally, and an interesting person to talk to
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	Gonna just say that he says he'll contact you in manaharamu, then asks you what item you wanted
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	Like, of the people you could have met  of this power level, this guy is the most pleasant
	by quite a margin
	

==== On Skui-Shi ====
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	I am not prepared
	internal screaming
	I have to be honest, whenever we met interesting people, my brain was like, this is my new adopted NPC
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	Remember that shardmind you met in Skalmirthon?
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	Ah, yes
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	That's her MO
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	heh
	Less like her
	More like I wanna be friends with them, and wanna keep in contact, cuz they seem interesting
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	By the time 5854 rolls around, she's got a city of creatures that she has adopted, though a bit more of a mother hen vibe
	And this is good
	there are facets of the story yet unexplored
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	I'm gonna make myself poor buying sending stones
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	Heh, there are ways to communicate with him that are far cheaper, but they're in the works
	he has a lot of people to keep tabs on unfortunately, such is the nature of power
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	With ALL the people?
	Because I've wanted to do this with the grassland people and the river people


==== On Headgear and Civilization ====
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	HA
	Helm of teleportation is a thing
	AS is the hat of disguise
	one of the most sophisticated items in game
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	Sophisticated?
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	of course
	If you see any monster, no matter how horrible, if it is wearing a hat then it is likely civilized
	Jormungandr06/06/2019
	Oh
	God, I hope you have hat-wearing monsters hidden away somewhere
	NirrumTheMad06/06/2019
	A couple
	Notably a bugbear with a 600ft spear throw
	good guy though, quiet, likes mining and cooking
	there are others, of course


==== On Airships and Antoine Welles ====
	Jormungandr22/07/2019
	Oh yeah, speaking of ships, how much (more) does the smallest ship cost, if I had it fitted out with a much better engine?
	If that is even possible
	NirrumTheMad22/07/2019
	Hard to get a better engine but there is a smaller fast ship you can get
	You just need to ask the right questions of the right people
	Jormungandr22/07/2019
	Basically a small, faster ship yes XD
	NirrumTheMad22/07/2019
	and it's not a long  questline to find it
	Jormungandr22/07/2019
	Welp, time to ask the only person who I know knows anything, aka Nirrum :I
	NirrumTheMad22/07/2019
	XD
	Nirrum actually gets mad about this topic
	Jormungandr22/07/2019
	Airships?
	NirrumTheMad22/07/2019
	the person you need to talk to
	
	The NPC Nirrum knows the person responsible for the delay in airship technological advancements and calls them a raging cunt for selling out to pirates
	Jormungandr22/07/2019
	Yiikes
	cracks knuckles Time to do absolutely nothing about it, because I have no leverage
	NirrumTheMad22/07/2019
	XD valid
	Though the airship dealer obviously knows how to get a hold of them
	
	
	

==== On Mahi, Nirrum's Siblings, and Ranger Studies ====
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	There's a ... silver? Dragon looking for a new home, right?
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	As of....
	this is what, late 5852 yeah?
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	I am not sure, honestly, most of that has gone over my head, as always
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	ye 5852, you guys doing the year at Manaharamu grants you a preliminary diploma in -thing- unless you test out, such as with sylvain who effectively has a bachelor of arts
	so the dragon looking for a home shows up in early 5853
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	test out?
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	(have more than one level in)
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Ah.
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	Three levels for a diploma, 14 for we can't really teach you more things
	but!
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Does the year in Mana prevent me from doing other things? Like talking to the Goliath tribe on the mountain, securing the place etc.
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	It does not, especially if you co-ordinate with the right course instructors
	Noteworthily, Ranger studies, the circles of Forest, Mountain, and Arctic, as well as the department of Conjuration
	Securing the place is going to be the hardest part of that
	Ranger studies is pretty forgiving for that though, The master is very much the sort of person who would take the entire program on a multi-month hike northward
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Heh. I like that. I don't think I'll pick up a level in ranger, I don't even know what I want to do honestly. I feel like she might enjoy that kind of study for the survival aspects, braving unsettled and wild places.
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	Which is still valid, blood hunter can benefit from ranger studies and Naneek... doesn't grade per se
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	That's almost ominous
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	"you survived, good, here's your diploma, here's a beer.... you already have a beer? Fuck off take another one, no one likes a quitter"
	You'd.... probably like him, very vibrant, super tolerant person. He's not booksmart but he's a sassy saucy bean
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	How far north would he take everyone?
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	Well y'know how Extra Sillig, Aralc and Nirrum are?
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Si
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	Well the master of ranger studies is the fourth and final sibling
	So yeah
	Far enough to make people think he's insane to try. Definitely more in tune with... reality, than the others
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Not gonna lie, I don't know who Sillig is, and only vaguely Aralc, but Nirrum says it all
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	Sillig is the guy with the rainbow bike
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Ahhhhhh
	I have not attached names well to people, only appearances hah
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	Aralc, Archfey of eyes, the big gay, Fairies and dresses
	S'coo, there's a lot of people
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Would he go to rifles through stuff Bladewater?
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	He'd not be able to get that far unfortunately
	Samadhi can only travel so fast
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Aww. I want to see the winged wolf-gryphons
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	You'll have to go see them when you graduate. The circle of the arctic druid would refuse to take you to bladewater, she's got bad blood with the people there unfortunately
	

==== On Treysa and the Kholirahi roots ====
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	You're thinking the world tree
	she's to the south, the Kholirahi are parasites using her severed roots to power their magic
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Am I hearing a crusade to free her.
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	Oh she's fine.
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	That seems like an undertaking far too large for me anyway
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	When the world shattered in the first cataclysm, she lost some of her roots to the north of the aegis
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	A parasite doesn't usually kill it's host anyway, because what would it mooch off of then
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	The Kholirahi found these still-living but disconnected roots and used them
	technically they're symbiotes but the organism they're symbiotic with tends to very much dislike them
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	How come the World Tree is a... "person"?
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	She's very much alive and capable of communicating
	Her species is a pretty standard cosmic being. Any time a planet or plane starts showing signs of being reasonably suitable for sapient life, they throw one of their seeds down on it, and that tends to help the life along
	they feed on magic generated by extreme emotions for the most part
	It's why you can only get so depressed or so angry
	after a while in any emotion, you just start feeling nothing new
	or in some cases, nothing
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Oh, so I suppose she isn't a person after all, at least not how I defined it to myself. Like, not a person person, more like an entity with a mind similar enough to our own that we can talk to it? Kinda.
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	Oh yeah no, she's pretty much just a tree
	wait
	no yeah she can straight talk
	fully sentient, communicative, social being
	Ultramagic tho
	Jormungandr23/07/2019
	Similar to the avatar of the World Tree in Guild Wars? Out of curiosity, how does she communicate with people?
	NirrumTheMad23/07/2019
	Minor illusion technically speaking.  You walk up to this big ol' tree and you start hearing a voice
	on occasion she puts out a dryad but very rarely
	

==== On Magic, Physics ====
Jormungandr23/09/2019
Yeah. I mean, it is unusual, but it's not like in Harry Potter where the world would burn them if it came out that they'd been... afflicted, I guess, with magic. It's more like an environment effect, or like a cold, something that you live with, something that just kind of happens. 

My thoughts kinda went tangenting at this point, but I think one of the reasons I like this kind of magic is that it its... inherent? to the world. The magic (for lack of a better word) lives in pretty much everything. It isn't just channeled through a wand or other instrument, or through a holy artifact, or some other divine godgiven powers, or passed down through a bloodline. Theoretically, given the right knowledge, everyone could use or just observe it.

NirrumTheMad23/09/2019
Same here
[20:29]
It's why I even have a physics document

Jormungandr23/09/2019
I think that's why I always go for component pouches over focus items. I dislike the idea that something is closed off to somebody because they weren't born right. That magic is something somehow separate and not really part of the world, that it's somehow secluded from it. If somebody can access magic, where does it come from? WHy doesn't it flow through the rest of the world?

NirrumTheMad23/09/2019
XD in other settings, gods. In my setting, nothing stops people from becoming a wizard, a druid,
[20:34]
Sorcerers are born with an innate connect, or a different shape in their magical field.  Clerics are given power, warlocks, taught to shape themselves
[20:36]
anyone can draw a ritual but only the powerful can test it as they go, meaning it has a chance to succeed. In all worlds I play in, I always look for those natural powrs

Jormungandr23/09/2019
Yeeh. In my world, magic is a kind of force that is in everything. Everyone can theoretically use it, but most knowledge of it has been slowly lost or been spirited away. There are a variety of branches of magic, but in their essence, they are all the same. There is a god-magic, which in theory is only wielded by beings of more or less pure magic. The gods are more like amalgamations of concepts who gained a consciousness. They are far more powerful than the average person can hope to achieve, because they are made of magic. They can, however, lend it. 
There's also hedge-magic, which works on association. Basically, it's why most magic works. To perform a spell, you need the right components that mean something to you. So a carrot can be an ingredient for a scrying spell, because it is (in western cultures, quite recently) associated with good eye-sight. A culture who never created this association would not be able to use the same component, but instead maybe a bird skull, or one of those rocks with a hole worn into them. Essentially, the caster can use their association of something with the object to draw out the magical potential. You need to believe it so it works. Or less believe, and more... have that connection. It's why good luck charms work in this world. The item is associated with good luck, and therefore becomes a good luck charm. This is why different cultures have different spells that all still work while also being totally different. 
There's also alchemy, which is basically magical chemistry, drawing out magical potential by reacting the magical stuff in things with each other. (Although a lot of magic in it's base principle is just a variation on hedge magic). 
There's a couple more, in theory infinitely more, but I have already rambled for quite a bit XD

NirrumTheMad23/09/2019
XD I could go on for longer with something similar, no worries there
[20:57]
One of the hardest questions to answer is what about the creatures that evolve in this magic?
[20:57]
There are a few noteworthy ones but why are they not far more magical
[20:58]
I've got a couple of ideas, but it's always fun to hear other people's answer to the idea of a completely magical creature, not unlike the mushi

Jormungandr23/09/2019
A lot of my world is actually baseline magical it's just literally so mundane it's not seen as magic. Like good luck charms. Or dream catchers. (Which are magical, just are nowadays more of a... thing you do, rather than something you actually believe? Or like knocking on wood.) Though it is mostly very lowkey magical, and not strong enough to be very noticable. Or that supernatural sense of knowing when somebody is watching you, kinda deal. 
On gods, it's also the reason why multiple gods exist with overlapping domains. Some are created by human belief, forming an already existing concept into a conscious, defined being, some awakened through the sheer force of magic kind of... balled together. Those tend to be nature gods, most notably among them the giant ocean spirit. Mostly, they are just called gods. They aren't actually divine, just very very powerful, and as I said, some were shaped into what they are by humans. Some by animals, some by just... popping into existance, because it is big. Or just because it is there. All living creatures have magic inside them, some just I guess have it more externally than others. It's more like a... life force, but it exists in all things, not just living
[21:29]
I'd listen to your take on that kinda stuff too, I like learning how other people integrate magic into their world
[21:29]
Actually just worldbuilding in general.

NirrumTheMad23/09/2019
There's always that gap left over. Between will and reality, the mechanism by which the mind is able to exert force. It's strange to think, such a tiny set of dominoes goes from 0-100 so quickly when your brain tells your muscles to move. When I started to explain magic, I started with cycles.

The idea was that magic was like a liquid, it flowed down channels made for it, and it flowed through time a bit differently than we do. Like an electron cycling around a circuit or even around a nucleus, This magic would follow it, though, separate, unable to really interact.  Magic would mirror  patterns that the world went through. things stuck together and forces were what they were because that's where magic (by coincidence) began sitting and then, when things kept doing that thing, those forces got stronger, more complete in their expression. When matter formed, Magic glommed it together, sticking to the vibrations, the electrical currents (or even the resistance), the heating and cooling. Whenever something was done many times, it became more real, and the magic sat closer to it
[21:43]
but all these patterns are these gigantic conglomerations of energies that just stacked up against each other in whatever way was convenient, when life arose, things got a little weirder. Newer, finer patterns could pop up in different places, in ridiculous ways, sometimes causing huge cascades of energy to bonk shit around. When people came to be, they eventually got a hold of this idea and began working with it. The big shapes and blocks were referred to as Symbols, as they were so similar to the idea of the object as well as the object itself when you look at the magic itself. The idea of a rock will always attach to a rock, the idea of a flower will always attach to a flower. The mind was able to generate so many of these small ideas that fit the larger ones so well, it meant that the larger ones can be manipulated
[21:45]
Composite symbols could cause a larger symbol to come crashing to a lower energy state, releasing its potential in the process. After a while, people were able to make fire by thinking of fire, and the symbols needed to make it.

But humans weren't the only thing. Self-referential patterns, processes that affect themselves are prone to causing some crazy shit to happen. Other creatures just straight evolved that way, some of them nearly entirely magical, existing as gaps between those ideas, causing them to move around and shuffle the world around them. Others just kinda tapped into it and got superpowers that way.

Gods are a weird one, I put them in three groups
[21:47]
Those made by mortals are just the result of such composite symbols and will fade away when they run their mathematical course.

Some were more of an evolutionary consequence of the forces, titanic and alien.

Others are mortals, ones that have accessed greater powers to change what they are and what that means
[21:48]
Using this, I can sing the world into a state where the dominoes fall in such a way that makes other dominoes stand and watch it go from there
29 September 2019

Jormungandr29/09/2019
Sorry for the late reply, I somehow go intimidated by the amount of text, and some anxiety of answering messages kicked in. (To be clear, it's not your fault, it's just something my brain does occasionally). ^^ 

Mind explaining the first bit to me again? I am not sure if I quite understand it. The magic attached itself as a kind of mirroring of things that were happening in this world. Magic is akin to concepts/ideas that have a kind of... "physical" presence? Things that happen more often/I guess more prominent would generate a stronger concept? 

Okay, and symbols kind of work by say... If you have fire, or maybe not fire, heat as an overarching concept, then you'd be able to create subcategories, like "Heating up" or "sun" or "fire" or "flying fireball to burn my enemies", and that is how beings control magic, by defining and so shaping a small piece of the bigger thing into something more specific, more manageable?(edited)
[21:49]
(Also how long does the first type of god make it? I'd love to see an example of that type of god. Like would a fire god made of sections of the large category "heat" exist as long as those subideas existed?)(edited)

Jormungandr29/09/2019
Unless I am totally misinterpreting the system

NirrumTheMad29/09/2019
Imagine a dragonfly over water or a magnet under metal on a rubber sheet. The indentation caused on the surface is kinda what the symbol is. The more something happens the easier the displacement, and the stronger the effect
[23:33]
Brains have a delightful tendency to interpret phenomena in a similar way every time so that makes it even easier, and you've got the specifics down. The first type of god is ultimately identical in technical aspects to a spell or a complex symbol, they usually pop up with worship. American gods style
[23:35]
They're  not as fundamental nor as powerful as their domains, the simpler something is in pattern the more potent

==== On Nirrum's Coat and some custom magic items, On Konian Silver knights, ====
Jormungandr15/03/2020
I want the coat of the Elder
[16:50]
I want pocketsies

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
XD
[16:50]
I need to make that reflect the true power of the coat. That's my coat. It is entirely likely to find some extremely random stuff inside it

Jormungandr15/03/2020
We have the sunstorm crown, right?

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
Indeed you do!
[16:52]
To date, objects that have come out of my pocket of that coat include:
* several woodwind instruments
* Approximately two ounces of fresh thyme
* A small wooden boat
* Several interesting rocks
* An actual Medicine pouch, containing a flattened coin, some novaculite, and a small figurine of a viking
[16:55]
* 75 feet of Paracord
* A sling and several suitable rocks for it
* A small local newspaper
* An abundance of dice
* A selection of scented candles
* A deck of cards
* A Deck of Magic cards
* A selection of tea bags
* A glass Chalice
* Four .22 bullets

Jormungandr15/03/2020
I like the Lakewaker.

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
Oh, and my personal favourite
* The Letters T, E, and B, from different display signs
[16:56]
Heh
[16:56]
Lakewaker is so cool, it's helpful for fishing but also not getting eaten by froghemoths

Jormungandr15/03/2020
I just like it's flavour. It stands out as a thing most so far. Besides Kawiki and the two winter blades(edited)

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
Ahhh I love Maki Kawiki, Currently in posession of Zog Earthshaka. It's got quite a bit of potential

Jormungandr15/03/2020

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
I needed a flavourful way of preventing the Thanus

Jormungandr15/03/2020
There's a slight spelling mistake (not quite) in Lohar, you misplaced a space somewhere in it(edited)

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
Ha, there's a few of those, I correct them as a see them

Jormungandr15/03/2020
Yeah, thought so. Just thought I'd point it out cuz it's a pain to read through this much text in correction, so you'll immediately know where to look XD

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
fair fair! I intend to grab Grammarly and go through all my work before it goes public and try to catch most of them XD

Jormungandr15/03/2020
Honestly, Bee is such a weird character, she's one of the few of mine that don't have a proper history besides "uhhh, Firbolg nation??" and very little reason to adventure, and next to no goals when she set out. The Grove was almost a sideproduct.
[17:04]
"Better Fists"

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
I've had that problem

Jormungandr15/03/2020
Ah yes, Item

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
XD gotta have something to give monks!

Jormungandr15/03/2020
I would kinda like to play a monk in your world at some point. But maybe I just like Monks? I haven't had one class that I really liked or disliked, though I have so far felt most powerful as Bee, and that one time Sincerity fucked Robin's dungeon and closely avoided the death of our entire party.
[17:06]
I like Better Fists though
[17:07]
Selfthrower Crossbow
	//Light// //Crossbow, Very rare, Requires attunement//
		Once a day, you can press the tickler on this crossbow without loading ammunition after saying the command word. You are then launched up to 80ft in the direction you pointed. If you land on a hard surface, you take 1d6 damage for every 10ft you were launched this way.

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
I've played Open palm monk a few times and I hated it, but I want to try the others. I've played enough now to know I really like clerics, paladins, barbarians, and bards

Jormungandr15/03/2020
I worry about this one

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
I love it. A chance to instantly kill many low level players if they use it

Jormungandr15/03/2020
I have only once played the same class, and that was a diffrent Bloodhunter subclass
[17:08]
Shame

HmmmmmMM

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
At some point I want to play a fighter that is rethemed entirely as a monstrosity
[17:08]
Oh yes! I need to put more of those in there

Jormungandr15/03/2020
"forged with magefire and weilded" still in shame, mixed another few letters!
[17:10]
I like it's history
[17:10]
The weaving and layering of magic sounds like something I'd describe how things came to be
[17:11]
Oh, there's a couple more letter switches in Shame

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
I'm very proud of that item, as painful as it is to think of
[17:11]
Unfortunately the text editor I use doesn't have a built-in spellcheck! The one that exists for it only works on linux

Jormungandr15/03/2020
Gurglethong
[17:13]
Excuse me

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
Heh, Thong refers to a strip of leather

Jormungandr15/03/2020
Yeh, I know, but that was NOT my first instinct XD
[17:14]
As an item it's dmn cool though
[17:14]
I like that one
[17:14]
It's simple and easy

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
I wanted to make slings relevant and having infinite ammo is really useful in survival

Jormungandr15/03/2020
Is Annam's Tongue the weapon the Oni had?

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
nooo that's just its own thing(edited)

Jormungandr15/03/2020
Rys faced us off with one and the weapon changed sizes, so some of us were rabidly trying to understand why

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
Heh, That was just part of the Danzuishanese maze, its description is up on my blog actually!

Jormungandr15/03/2020
Necrospike seems a bit like a glorified shovel, in a way XD

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020

I bet Lavinia would love that, if she wasn't a cleric

What'll really bite you is when you realize there's no wizard archetype that is proficient with pikes

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
hey, free spells for  an undead army is just a good time
[17:22]
there's actually a little bit of story on a few of the next ones that's not written down on them

Jormungandr15/03/2020
The Forcehammer seems a lot like Moses' staff, plus some extra benefits

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
Indeed! It was partially inspired by it

Jormungandr15/03/2020
Dimensional Slide Abacus
	//Wondrous item, Uncommon, Requires attunement by an artificer or a wizard//
		Casting a spell as a ritual only adds five minutes to the casting time.

Dope

NirrumTheMad15/03/2020
The Silver Knights were the Konian special forces. Level 11+ fighters and where they had been at war with the Manaharahi from the second the two made contact with each other, they are partially build to deal with magical bullshit.

The Goatrider items are from the fallen Empire of Graoton, Which had a tradition of Eldritch knights mounted on giant goats
[17:25]
ye! that's roughly where I am now in making these items
[17:25]
BUT
[17:25]
for the next batch you need something

==== On Dinosaurs and Gods ====
Jormungandr18/03/2020
Do shavers (whatever they are called. Shears. electric shears.) exist in tis world

NirrumTheMad18/03/2020
Electric ones no, they have yet to invent the circular motor
[21:36]
Currently all they have is a passive retraction single-action coil motor
[21:37]
They're on the very edge of the cusp of inventing a proper motor but no one has had the idea of "let's make this go round" and the right hand rule hasn't been figured out yet

Jormungandr18/03/2020
What if someone falls onto this plane with the knowledge?

NirrumTheMad18/03/2020
then it is a great boon to the plane
[21:39]
Plane and simple

Jormungandr18/03/2020
Also, if the gods fell into Snarl, are they removed from where they were? Is there only one copy? What happens to all the other planes
[21:40]
Schrödinger's gods?

NirrumTheMad18/03/2020
Snarl is a curiosity to most gods. Most gods were previously mortals that managed to accrue a divine portfolio. Normally, gods cannot leave their spheres and travel the realms but the way some people leave their sphere to get to the prison planes, they occasionally leave tunnels. The gods are able to traverse these tunnels and once they are established there, they can set up grander, more efficient means. The gods are disconnected mostly from their homes while they are here, but some take advantage of the time dilation effects so they're not missed. Others disappear from their old home entirely
[21:43]
mostly there is only one copy, but some gods have run into other versions of themselves and either left that quandry well enough alone or occasionally combined into greater and greater beings

Jormungandr18/03/2020
Hm. God vore.
[21:45]
God Ouroborous?

NirrumTheMad18/03/2020
on occasion, likely

Jormungandr18/03/2020
If there's multiple prison planes, what happens to the gods across each. Do they just not exist in some?
[21:47]
Or more like, I guess, when a god is only on SNarl

NirrumTheMad18/03/2020
you can usually assume that the same gods can reach the different prison planes (depending on their nature) but here their power is much less impressive. Lolth and Yondalla for example both have extremely limited power on these planes because it's not worth their time and the stakes are high here, higher than either of them are willing to take on

Jormungandr18/03/2020
Which one's Yondalla?

NirrumTheMad18/03/2020
halfling chief god
[21:50]
gives them their luck
[21:50]
much like lolth gives the drow their crazy

Jormungandr18/03/2020
Are SNarl Halflings unluckier
[21:53]
There's a joke in there somewhere

NirrumTheMad18/03/2020
they still have their feat but otherwise, yeah, the Ramishi are a far shot from your average halfling, though there are a few around
[21:53]
Come to think of it, the Eberron Talenta Halflings have much the same schtick but they ride dinosaurs

Jormungandr18/03/2020
I would say that's a bonus, but I'm not actually a fan of dinos in magic settings like these.

NirrumTheMad18/03/2020
heh, they have their places when they're properly naturalized. On Snarl there's one plateau with them but they don't show up often elsewhere

Jormungandr18/03/2020
I guess dinos just seem too... real/historical, and also removed from anything approximately us for me to enjoy them in these settings. Most often, they just feel gimicky, or just... cool, dinos exist, without thinking how they fit in the world

NirrumTheMad18/03/2020
If I was going to do them again they'd just be a naturalized part of the world, like you'd see herds of elephants get into conflict with an occasional Ankylosaur

Jormungandr18/03/2020
Hm. I suppose it's also kinda a suspension of belief thing. I know roughly how dinos do against each other, and how humans would likely fare, and I suppose you could vaguely compare them to dragons, but somehow the fact that dragons are entirely made up makes it seem a little more like people could live alongside them. Also that dragons in stories tend to be far less common, while dinos are often vast herds, or at least groups, not just single, very far apart individuals.

NirrumTheMad18/03/2020
Which is true and fair, but they're not too different from how I've utilized owlbears or wyverns
[22:11]
ultimately they don't really have a thematic place in my plane other than as set dressing
