		**Verbing**
			Manar evolved with the idea that any noun is also a verb that is modified by its subject and it is only by immersion in the language that you learn to interpret the context of some of the stranger ones. These noun-pairings tend to rely on context. Ulla'ti'lo, for example would be  the answer to the question of "how will we get water?" and would mean "We will be welling" with "welling" being implied to be something to do with or for a well, and really, one of the few things you can do with a well is find or dig one. Ulla'ti'lo
			
		**Specific Subject**
			When Verbing, to indicate a specific subject, the properties of the subject come after the verb, Pruwa'ta fani lor, rest does the pink rabbit. The Pink rabbit rests. De pet neshta Pep'ab Ta Lor Fani  (the surface [it moved to], Hopped [onto],  the rabbit pink ) (The pink rabbit hopped onto the surface(table)) (CONTEXT&SPECIFY)(VERB-subjective)(SUBJECT & compliment if )
