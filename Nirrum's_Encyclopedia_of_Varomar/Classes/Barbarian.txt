====== Barbarian ======
Created Saturday 02 May 2020

There are hundreds of ways to be a barbarian in Snarl. To control a force that offers great fortidue is limited to no culture, no one way of life, and anyone can become such a being, though few are successful at it. Often Barbarians come from circumstances that force them to overcome great injury, though not always.

Maybe you are a very typical image of a Barbarian, from rural and isolated people like the Barabrian culture in the Gannaga, or up in the frigid tundra near Bladewater. Maybe you are an Aulufeydth from the feywild training in the Mohara monastery to channel magic instead  of rage. Perhaps you were born in Kholira and ripped the roots from your body, only to experience overwhelming emotion. You may simply be posessed by some spirit, or have been touched by the Archfey of the Court of Terror. There are many places your power can come from.

Barbarians as a group are rare, and it is not often that there is a dedicated force or culture of them. Exceptions lie among the aescetic monks on the lower peak of Mohara, as well as the Orcs of Broomb's  Band and the Valley of War. By the nature of their abilities, they are generally disruptive, and thus not particularly valued in any of the larger civilizations
