====== Paladin ======
Created Friday 29 October 2021

It is always worth noting that a Paladin is powered by the force of their will, not their connection to a deity. Conviction is their magic, and because of Snarl's history of strife, there is //plenty// of conviction. Paladins come from all societies, all lifestyles, and all contexts. There is no society that does not view paladins favorably because of their ability to cure diseases and heal wounds. Their ability to detect harmful beings, to protect from them, and to eliminate them is awed by  every child. Among the Manarahi, Paladins almost always join their militaries in some fashion. For the Danzuishanese, often Paladins find themselves within the depths of the great maze. Konian Paladins are very frequently associated with the church. Even among the arguably lawless land of Dwallat, Paladins spring forward out of the will to survive, and often find great success because of that will.
