====== Artificer ======
Created Sunday 26 April 2020

Artificers are Uncommon but known in snarl. Nearly every decently sized town has at least one, but rarely many more. They work with all sorts of constructs as engineers, inventors, and workers that understand the fundamental technical principles behind what now drives life on Snarl. They work with each municipalities' electrical grid, with their magic items, and with their mundane infrastructure.

Artificers are intelligent, always able to make connections that even wizards struggle with. The Interplay of Mortals, Magic and Matter understood by no one better than they. Thus they are guided to or arise from the places where such intelligence is needed. Most well known is the Artificery and Temple to Ogmha and Erathis, presided over by Yalali, the Angel of Oghma, its great cylindrical hall made entirely of metal, save the great glass window that stands over the hospital portion. Others might come from Skalmirthon, where the works of the dwarves churn ever forward. The dwarves are slow to invent and adapt to change, but make great use of what they know, and when they learn something new, they become masters and on top of that, Skalmirthon isn't //just// home to dwarves. Perhaps one might come from Danzuishan, where their great dam needs constant attention, and where The Maze has perpetual surprises. Possibly they were tutored in Brekmu, the home of the gnomes, or perhaps they puzzled out life on their own.
