Druids on Snarl have a unique place. Such an artificial world could be thought to lack the spirits of nature, but no, the prison itself is warded by the world-speaker spirit, a scorpion with a tail that spans the cosmos. The feywild has made a connection here and is not terribly hard to reach. Life flourishes on Snarl, largely under the guidance of druids. Druids are far more active on snarl than they are in other places. There are no Cultural leanings against the use of metal, nor are druids particularly secretive. Indeed, Druids here are clever folk who let the magic around them do their will, and in return they foster that magic. Druids are often honored deeply among the people of Snarl as practical mages. Though be warned. Nature isn't as simple as that which is not made by tools. All life fights to thrive, Foster the life that bolsters your magic.

You may come from Kholira, an entire empire of druids from the circle of parasites (spores), who use roots under their skin to dull their emotions and focus their senses. Their god king can move the sun and moon and even their children can feel the magic of the world tree. You may come from the Rainbow mountain, where devotees to Sylvanus tend to the wilds that came after the wheat. Perhaps you are from Manaharamu, where the University hosts many druid circles and their archdruids for educating those who wish to learn. Others might come from the grass road, where the line between artificial and natural blurs heavily. On Occasion, someone might venture far from Xia Ochiko to find fame and fortune in far lands. Even still, you may come from off plane, or anywhere on or within this one.
