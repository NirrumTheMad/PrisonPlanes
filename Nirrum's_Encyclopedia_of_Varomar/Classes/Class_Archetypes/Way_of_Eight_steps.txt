**Nondichotomy**
	When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you unlock magic that eclipses what most mages learn in potency. You may use intelligence instead of wisdom for monk class features like unarmoured defense, and Ki. You gain training in Arcana. 

**Three Seals of Flow**
	Your mastery of mana allows you to spend a ki point to enter one of the following states of power at the start of your turn. You may only be in one state of power at a time:
		* Your ki effects are not affected by Antimagic, dead magic zones, or wild magic for 1 minute or until you end this effect as a bonus action
		* You add your proficiency bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn. All attack rolls and saving throws are made without proficiency
		* Your movement speed becomes 0 but you can use Deflect missiles an unlimited number of times without expending your reaction or ki until the end of your next turn

**Wakefish leap**
	When you are affected by a spell or magical ability that you perceive, you may use your reaction to teleport up to your move speed toward the caster. 

**Candle in the Night**
	Starting at 11th level, you become a great beacon for magic. 
		* You may allow creatures of your choice to cast spells through you as if you were the caster of those spells, using their spellcasting modifier and spell slots
		* For 1 ki point, you may cast a cantrip that an Ally within 120ft of you knows, using the appropriate action
		* As an Action, you may spend 1 ki point to make an arcana check against a spell that you can see or hear. If the result of your check exceeds 10+The caster's spellcasting modifier. If you succeed, you recover ki points equal to your proficiency bonus and the spell ends. 

**Six Arcane Seals**
	Starting at level 17 you gain access to the following states of power. You may spend a ki point at the start of your turn to enter one of these states. You may only be in one state of power at a time
		* You project an antimagic field in a 10ft sphere around you, this lasts for one minute or until you end the effect as a bonus action. 
		* Each time a target you can see or hear casts a spell, you may spend a number of Ki points equal to the spell's level to cast the same spell on your turn. This lasts for one minute or until you end the effect as a bonus action
		* You resist all damage except bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing until the end of your next turn
		* All spells cast within 40ft of you trigger a wild magic surge centred on the caster until the start of your next turn
		* If a target you can see or hear attempts to cast a spell within 120ft of you, that spell's area of effect is centred on you, or targetting you, regardless of if the spell could normally reach or target you. This lasts for one minute or until you end the effect as a bonus action.
		* You can cast counterspell for 3 ki points and an additional ki point for each spell slot level beyond 3rd
