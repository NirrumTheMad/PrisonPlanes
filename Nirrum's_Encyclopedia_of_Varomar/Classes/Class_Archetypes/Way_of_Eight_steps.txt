**Disciple of Magic**
	When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn how to manipulate Magic with your ki. Choose
choose two disciplines, learn more at 6.11.17, gain a level to replace
Casting E Spells. Some e
disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10
of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of
spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its
casting time and other rules, but you don’t need to
provide material components for it. When you cast a
spell with a discipline, it is cast at the spell’s lowest
level unless otherwise specified.
Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend
additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental
discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has
an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands
does. The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional
ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level
monk and use ROPADOPE FIX THISyou can spend 2 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level
spell (the discipline’s base cost of 1 ki point plus 1).
The maximum number of ki points (its base ki point
cost plus any additional points) that you can spend on
the spell is 2, unless a discipline specifies otherwise.
This maximum increases to 3 at 9th level, 4 at 13th
level, and 5 at 17th level.
