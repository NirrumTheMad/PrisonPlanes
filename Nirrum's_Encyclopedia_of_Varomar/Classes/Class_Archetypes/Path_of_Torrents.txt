====== Path of Torrents ======
Created Saturday 21 March 2020

So often among the Manarahi, people are born with great focus and great recklessness. To tame this great recklessness, they are half pressured, half drawn to the halls of the Mohara Ascetic Monks, which also houses the Manaharamu Power plant. Those that take this way can learn to follow the Path of Torrents. To call what they go through "rage" is a weak association with others of similar power. They enter what they call  Ta Walshkao. The wave thoughts. To the Manarahi, Water is never still. Its default state is motion, waves. In their mind the concept of neutral energy and motion are not exclusive. A Barbarian of the path of torrents allows magic to course through them by crafting magical channels through their body. This process requires intense meditation and study and is exceedingly reckless. During Ta Walshkao, the barbarian is fully aware and capable of thinking but they are hyperfocused.


**Ta Walshkao**
	When you choose this path at 3rd level, You are able to concentrate on spells while raging. 
	Choose one first level spell from any spell list. You know this spell and while you are raging you can cast it at its lowest level a number of times equal to your intelligence modifier(minimum 1)  without expending a spell slot (you do not gain spell slots form this feature). A spell cast this way uses your Intelligence as your spellcasting ability and does not require material components. While you are not raging, you can only cast this spell using the appropriate spell slots. If your rage would end because you did not attack or take damage since the end of your last turn, your rage does not end if you cast or were concentrating on a spell this turn.
		At 9th Level you learn one 2nd level spell and can cast it with the same conditions
		At 14th level you learn one 3rd level spell and can cast it with the same conditions.
