	**Horde Breaker. **When you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within range of your weapon.
	**Warning Glance. **Creatures of your choice gain a bonus to initiative equal to your wisdom modifier and cannot be surprised.

	**Multiattack Defense. **When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.
	 **Evasion. **You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
	**Uncanny** **Dodge**. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.
