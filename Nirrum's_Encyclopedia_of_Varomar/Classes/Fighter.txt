====== Fighter ======
Created Friday 29 October 2021

Snarl is a vicious place, and while eugenics tends to be a horribly inefficient and awfully executed affair, there is something to be said for people who are universally descended from people who were the sorts of people that got targetted with 5th level spells like banishment, or plane shift, or even just experimental teleportation magic that ended up backfiring. There are very few ancestors who were "common" in any sense. For eight thousand years the people of this place have fought against horrendous odds and with whatever tools they have. Those who don't use magic turn to might, sometimes a bit of both, to turn the tide against their foes.

Varomar is host to a wide range of Martial traditions, every single civilization has at least one fairly unique method of fighting, they are described in detail elsewhere in this document. From the Dwarven siege tactics, to the Danzuishanese Razers and Maze Runners. From the Aulufeydth Green Knights, to the Konian Silver Knights. From the Turtle Pirates, to the Old Graoton Goatriders. From the Ramishi ambushers and outriders of the Grass road, to the Iron wings of Sha'at Daar. 

Fighters are viewed Favourably in most civilizations. Often with awe from children and varying levels of respect from adults. In Manaharamu, one might do well to not be Labelled a Taparmishi, a sellsword or adventurer, for they are the lowest tolerable members of society, but elsewhere, a sword is a sword and a good arm to wield it is an arm you want attached to a friend.
