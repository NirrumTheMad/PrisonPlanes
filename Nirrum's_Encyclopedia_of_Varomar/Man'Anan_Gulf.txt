====== Man'Anan Gulf ======
Created Friday 20 October 2023

One of the calmest regions on the plane, The man'anan is a peaceful sea, the coast settled largely by Manarahi groups that diverged from their culture during the prime of Mana'ulla, Reconnecting during the age of Manaharamu. The Dialect of Manar here is strange, and sometimes it is difficult for anyone from outside the region to understand the people here. The population is hardly homogenous, Humans of Off-plane and Konian descent, Hobgoblins, Lizardfolk, and Kalashtar also settle in the gulf, though most of them speak manar primarily or secondarily. As time goes on, Common slowly replaces Manar as the dominant language, and what pockets speak only manar have become increasingly divergent from the main branch dialects. The coastline, down to the thunder coast is one of the rainiest locations on the plane, recieving some form of precipitation for about 2/3rds of the year, particularly on the north eastern part of the coast toward ganglegrove. Even when it is sunny, it is often muggy and humid, but when the winter hits the rest of the plane, the air becomes dry for a few months for most areas, coinciding with local grain harvests

The Gulf itself is not without civilization. Often, where reefs have build up on post-cataclism sediment, Oceanic settlements make their home.  Huge Kelp forests, Coral reefs, underwater canyons and thermal vents line the floor of the gulf, providing diverse habitat. 

But where there is abundance, there is also danger. More than one Kraken has made their home in the bay, and Plesiosauruses frequent the shallower waters. Sharks are common and many fish are dangerous in other ways. Other creatures of the deep, undead, and things yet undescribed. The waters of the man'anan are thankfully not as warm as those of the dragon gulf
