====== The Court of Glamour and Eloquence ======
Created Sunday 23 August 2020


The Archfey of the court of Glamour and Eloquence are powerful, and All use their name unchanged. 
Set among the darker regions of the feydark mostly, 



==== The Stonestands ====
	In a Dizzying peatland, the Stonestands are the home of the **Neriadniclu, Archfey of Beginnings and Endings. **The stonestands are easily spotted as a garden of vines and 10ft tall cylindrical statues, 


==== Darkbar ====
	In the feydark, just off a stageroad is the darkbar, the darkbar is the anti-xanrans. The length of the bar is arguably infinite, and there is always a bartender nearby, though one always has to wait for at least one other person to be served before you are attended to. The bar takes only favour, though the quality of favour doesn't need to be high. They will only take regular currencies  from fey of the court of lore, particularly gnomes, though they are a bit spiteful about it. The bar is always smokey, and smells of tobacco in a rather inoffensive way.  They serve every type of mundane drink, composed of fey magic, and usually of high quality, though, the atmosphere is what makes the darkbar a place to go. along the wall opposite the bar are Divot booths with tables and long chairs for groups. In one of them sits Thorcurin  Archfey of Tongues.
