====== The Court of Lore ======
Created Friday 14 August 2020


The court of lore is one of the strangest of the courts by nature of being the most familiar. The fey in this group are crafters of objects. Machines, shoes, carvings, dictionaries. Because of this peculiarity, they don't necessarily require favours, as their favours //are// material goods and exchanged services. It has been proposed more than once that all humanoid species and most creatures of the humanbonkers realm are fey of this type, but I am assured that this is not the case, though it does appear to be true for **gnomes. **By this nature, they are bound and bind with... well.. cages, chains, physical restraints. 


To a creature born into the Court of Lore, physical forces are what govern the rule of favour. The tightest curling of forces, the most abstract limits of their mathematics, the most distinguished curl of ink on a page, all stand to nourish them. A Lore Fey's craft is craft itself. Skill in the workfolkship of any object that lasts beyond their hands. They have the most solid works of any fey and care the least for promises

==== The Clockwork Castle And Tower of Lightning ====
	Built in a blasted plain on the stormy side of the morning, a Nacrous green castle with copper beams and trim stands watch around an impossibly tall standstone tower. The castle is filled with sounds of ticking and quiet but ponderous gears turning. The Clockwork castle houses seven vast machines, all warded and presided over by the **Lord of Wiles and Stone, The Gammunacteries Rayl. **The Rayl, the archfey of sequences, is the one who decides what crafts can be made real. They hold a very powerful place among the fey as a governing body used to deter certain horrors from emerging in the feywild. The Rayl is the only creature that can speak with **the Warden of Lightning, Archfey and ruler of the court of Lore. **The Warden of Lightning is an immensely powerful being that bestows raw inspiration unto the fey. They are the portal through which much of the magic of the feywild flows. They exist beyond the comprehension and power scales of most beings. In the eyes of the gods, the warden of lightning is as a sword, less powerful in a broad sense, but nearly indisputable in others. They sit within the tower of lightning, which acts as a gutter, allowing the magic that flows from them to enter the machinery of the clockwork castle, from which it disperses into the feywild.
	
	The Seven Machines housed in the clockwork tower each serve a different function, originally there were six until the potency of the vital pump was revealed to be useful to more mortal creatures
		* The wheel of the self-contained concept is a wide device of incredible efficiency that can make certain types of magic apply permanently to certain items. This is power beyond what can be found in the phb.
		* The Pendulum of duality has two functions. It can either invert the function of an item on a conceptual level or double its capacity, but can only do so once in each direction, and its effect depends on the direction the pendulum is currently swinging. If some aspect of the item is doubled, it becomes highly unstable, and has a 1 in 8000 chance of simply ceasing to exist at any moment (three critical failures in a row). The item cannot be boosted past a +5, nor can the pendulum boost the damage of a spell or an ability that a creature has. Inversion is best interpretted by the dungeon master with the advice that it is a conceptual inversion, it doesn't need to make perfect sense, but just enough. Sovreign glue can become either a terrifying explosive or just universal solvent.
		* The Vital Pump is a strange conversion device that originally wasn't one of the seven, as it is barely useful to the fey. The Device can double your remaining lifespan at the cost of half of your hit point maximum and vice versa.  The exchange is permanent and cannot be undone by anything other than the pump short of 10th level magic as you are //rewritten.//
		* The Residuum grinder is a set of eight two-tumbler grinders with increasingly fine sets of teeth that is used by the fey to utterly destroy magic items. The grinder works especially well at destroying legendary  items but it has some difficulty with artifacts. It cannot destroy anything created by the "Create seal" spell, or any other sealing artifact without advanced other rituals. **The Gammunacteries Rayl** may decide to help if the artifact is likely to draw one of the horrors from outside the realm. The grinder produces Residuum, a handy material roooooughly its weight in gold, with the massive upshot of being very easy to work with in making magic items. There is some loss and the grinder produces about 75% of the amount of residuum that would be required to make the ground item. 
		* The Garcrystalline Manaphone is a 128 tone cylinder. 8 honer, 6 Resonator, 2 mode Manaphone. Made from garcrystals, a magical and generally brittle crystal that appears to be breathing (thought it is just experiencing a slightly excited state) when activated. The crystals have a sort of four dimensional chirality such that magic passing throug them can be thought of like a chain of sausage links, where the sausages continually inflate and deflate with each sausage being at its peak inflation when either  adjacent sausage has appeared empty for quite some time. When oriented Parellel to a magical field (exhibiting 1,2 left, and 3,4 right waveforms), the crystals will vibrate gently. Activating one of the 128 Tone cylinders, giving a rough waveform output of the energy density per second per second of a given magical field. The 8 honers can be used to eliminate crosstalk in one of 256 possible configurations. The six resonators can translate a massively wide section of the magical spectrum into wavelengths more understandable by beings of our energy states, capable of capturing wavelengths as long as some universe all the way up to near theoretical spatial maxima. The Resonateors  also serve as limiters, and are very tough, and might not break through even divine intervention, though, **The Gammunacteries Rayl** has had to replace broken resonator plates twice as eldritch abominations greater than the comprehension of even the most powerful beings that can be spoken about in words came too close to the boundaries of this layer of the Far realm. If oriented perpendicular to a given magical field (or intersecting), the crystals instead light up as they vibrate, and the resulting waveform produced by the Manaphone can be used to reproduce or reanalyze any such magic. This can **allow specific forms of some spells to be translated into academic magical forms. In essence, allowing wizards and artificers specifically to learn spells from other classes given enough time to study. **It is worth noting that **The Gammunacteries Rayl has a special room for examining spells, **and requests that any experimentation that he allows is performed in that room in order to keep the machines safe.
			* //Nirrum's note: OK that's something I need to tell people once I get back, that's really handy//
			* **Dm's Note: **Healing spells, sadly won't work this way, Spells that require an intelligent analisys of the current context and customized responses **can **be read this way, but will only be able to replicate that exact result.  Spells such as Speak with animals, hallow,  and tree stride are all free game. Of the spells that resurrect, Revivify and Raise dead are the only ones that work, as they do not attempt to heal wounds. Guardian of Faith and Contact planar ally and similar spells that require communal with gods *can* facilitate communication but might also draw the ire of any given planar entitty.
		* The channel and preliminary diffusers are several systems of magical conduit and massive spinning wheels through which flow condensed athaumatic Mana. This was built in the early days of snarl by the gnomes brought in by **Thenagarurokamon, ** with the intent of reinforcing the prison by absolutely soaking it in powerful magic. There's not much that this machine can do for adventurers  or pilgrims but if you open the pipe and stick your hand in it and you're a caster, you get all of your spell slots back at the cost of one level of exhaustion. Non-casters might find themselves able to very termporarily cast low level paladin , warlock, or sorcerer spells, an effect that fades after about a minute. 
		* The Clock is the final of the seven mechanisms, and incorporates much of the castle in its working. **The Gammunacteries Rayl** uses this clock as the ultimate shield against  impending destruction. The clock under the guidance of the Rayl as well as with the aid of the warden of lightning is capable of stopping time for one creature or entity indefinitely, with only casts of **Superior Disenchantment** being capable of removing it. Thankfully this is usually enough to cause some greater abominations of the far realm to turn away from this layer. **The Warden of Lightning** tells the Rayl that stopping time is no different than an urchin with poison spikes on the ocean floor to these abominations. What is lethal to one is an inconvenience to another. 

	**The Warden of lightning is too powerful to really describe here, The concepts of swords or magic exist in states so far below their existence that there is no reason to include stats. The Warden of lightning, Ruler of the Court of lore apparently can only be described as a hypermetagnome. **Hypermetagnome, a word which exists exclusively to describe the Warden of Lightning, is a hyperintelligent sapient being that exists as a seies of thoughts composed of interactions  at high energy states within the incredibly dense magical field that  flows through them. They are closer to an incredibly powerful spell than they are any sort of creature. **The Gammunacteries Rayl** still describes them as inquisitive, somewhat insensitive, and a deep learner who delights in facilitating exploration where they can, though their interactions don't function as direct boons or magic, but as series of favourable or interesting events that may happen at various points throughout time and space //particularly// around this prison plane. Despite this, their most useful "location" is at the top of the tower of lightning, named such because, despite numerous lightning rods, it does keep getting hit by magical lightning.
		//Nirrum's Note: Turns out lightning rods actually prevent lightning from striking normal buildings by normalizing electric potential. Neat. //
	

	


==== Gnomeshop ====
	//Nirrum's note: Finding this place officially makes me 10x more hip than Mordenkainen//
	 
	In a cold and snowy region near the noonside of the feywild is the mighty Gnomeshop. the steeply sloped Aframe is dotted with chimneys and vents. Medium-sized red doors  set in the external logs of the building are nearly always open as gnomes cart  materials and projects in
