==== The Paradox Corridor ====
	Attached quite directly to the Spiral Tower is this quiet hallway. It is of a narratively infinite length, as many things in the feywild are. Only one person may enter it at a time, though, as the name implies, many people can make use of the corridor at once. Rather it is that you are alone in the corridor once you enter along with an infinite other number of selves. The corridor is made of mirrors such that you can see your reflection going off for quite a distance on either side, and when you decide to stop moving along the corridor, others will pop into existence around you as if other mirror angles were being added. These reflections can and do move independently of you, though they will all attempt to do the same thing you're doing, roughly at the same time with some variations. If you train in the corridor for at least one week (you are allowed to leave and come back it's just regular practice) on a specific task such as a single musical piece, a speech, a carving, or any ability check, you will have permanent advantage on that specific check, provided you practice it at least once a month after leaving the corridor. On Occasion, among your reflections you may find one of two different Archfey in the corridor as well, either copying your work or frantically trying to 

==== The Spiral Academy ====
	The spiral academy is a Large conical drill-shaped tower which can only ever be found near the dawnpoint. There is only one entrance to the tower which is at its base. Outside there is a sign which shifts language to read 
	**"This tower is a test of resolve. The Price for failure is likely death, and the chance of failure is extremely high. Do not bring the weak in with you. Do not bring that which cannot decide for itself with you. Do not bring in the things you are not willing to risk. Bring only yourself and your courage" **
	
	A series of baskets on a shelf wait outside  the entrance with their own sign saying "no promises" on each one.
	
	**If you have players that played** **this dungeon before, ask them now to not spoil it and let others "experience it on their own merit"**
	 Following the spiral groove on the outside of the tower, the interior is an array of rooms all filled with challenges, but they are not ordinary challenges. The Challenges presented below and are in order.
		* A stone that is 30ft on all sides blocks the first door. Touching the stone does nothing, it is not an illusion. There are no gaps around the stone, and attempting to teleport behind the stone makes the teleport fail and the person teleporting take 6 bludgeoning Damage (often, they will develop a fist shaped bruise on their face for a week or so or until they recieve magical healing). As soon as someone tries to move the stone, it rolls aside effortlessly, crashing onto its side as though it weighed hundreds of tonnes. People caught under it as it rolls find that they can hold it off of them but not change its course. 
		* A rough wall with only small handholds and a very tiny light indicating the top, several hundred feet away. Attempting to fly or teleport will only get you thrown back down by some magical force. No matter what height you are thrown from, you will only take 6 bludgeoning damage (and possibly develop a hand shaped bruise on the centre of your chest, as above). Attempting to climb the wall is an automatic success, the wall is lightly sticky and  gravity seems less powerful while climbing
		* A raging river crosses the next room, it is too wide to see the other side. Stepping into the river  without preparation forces a person to make a dc 25 Dexterity save to not be swept away at a rate of 60ft/round. Attempting to fly out of the river will result in getting hit with a wave. Attempting  to freeze the river will result in the ice being washed away at the same speed. Any attempt to swim after being washed away succeeds. 
		* An open flat room with no obstruction other than a closed (and currently fake) metal door on the other end greets any group travelling together after the river. As soon as the group is within the room, the floor falls out and they drop 1000ft, over five rounds taking 20d6 damage if they reach the bottom. Any attempt at all with one's own abilities (cleric spells included)  to save their own life causes people to disappear ( their attempt succeeds as they find themselves on the floor that just dropped out below them, prone, though **do not describe this until everyone gets it or hits the ground)**. Any attempt to  save someone else fails as magical winds rip people apart and tear spells apart but if the person who attempted to save another survives the fall, they gain a secret fey favour (**From the rigid baron) ** and one inspiration die (**From the Scion of fire). **If someone fails this challenge, they must start the tower from the beginning, to everyone else, the door opens revealing the shape of another door in white paint on the wall behind it, which can be opened to reveal the path.
		* The next floor has wide room with a firey cauldron with a 5ft radius in the middle with 10 torches around the room (or 2x the number of party members). At the end of each turn, one torch goes out in a counterclockwise order. The torches do not need fuel and can be lit endlessly. In the center of the cauldron is a dial that rotates to point toward the torch that is about to go out. The dial spins slowly and can be rotated backwards. If it is rotated past a torch that has gone out, that torch relights. The fire in the bowl in the middle deals damage once every round (initative 20 if needed) equal to the number of torches gone out +1  but it does not spread beyond the bowl.  The pathway to the next room reveals itself once all the torches have gone out. 
		* The next hallway is a long spiralling corridor filled with octarine, red, and blue fire. The fire ignores all immunities but not resistances and deals 1d10 damage per turn to any creature standing in the hallway. It is real fire and will burn nonmagical objects that are not somehow protected, including spellbooks, most forms of clothing, and wands. items that are made out of wood and somewhat thick will be singed. **The fire cannot kill or knock anyone unconscious**. The hallway is inclined upward and goes on for 280ft. 
		* In the next room, there is a large, serrated spike pointing upward in the middle of a series of shallow grooves in the floor. An obelisk stands among the channels, where, written once in every scribable language except Infernal, Primordial, Celestial, and Druidic, is the phrase "Only willing death upon the spike can open the door. Lies or Enchantment will hurt those who make them." A Player may  offer to give their life, either by jumping on the spike. A soul-trapping spell is placed on the spike and is easily identifiable with Identify or a DC 15 Arcana check. No spells like clone or reincarnation will work against death by this spike. Once a player impales themselves and dies, the door to the next room opens
			* Groups of players who decide collectively that a death isn't worth it and walk back out of the room will find themselves in the room after the one containing  **The Gau-Magmes **upon exiting the room
			* Players who willingly throw themselves on the spike appear as they were before the spike in the room after  chamber containing **the Gau-Magmes**  after everyone has left this room. **To all intents and purposes until then, they are dead** (so get a hold of their character sheet before it gets destroyed if that's something you do)
			* If a character is under the influence of any spell or is charmed, frightened, or in any way coerced or tricked into giving up their life, then once they attempt to place themselves on the spike, the source of the magic or coercion takes 5d10 Psychic damage, regardless of their location and if the magic is equivalent to or under magic of the 5th level, it is permanently undone. If it is not magical, then the deception or malice is revealed. The Spike will not accept that character unless they choose to volunteer anyway.
		* The next room is merely a window  that shows a party going through the Pitfall in the fourth room. If anyone tries to warn them about the trap or how to solve it, they are teleported to the bottom of the tower and have to repeat the entire dungeon, not counting the death spike room. If the character redoes the tower, no other parties are visible until they reach ths room, where a different party is doing the same thing. If a person warns a party a second time, the cycle repeats, If a person does this a third time, the door in front of them opens and they do not get teleported but they are slowed for the entirety of the next room. Individuals who do not attempt to warn the parties going through the pitfall room can simply open the door to the next room
		* The next room is a wide and round arena-like room with benches filled with angry and yelling fey. A Thin and frail archfey **The Gau-Magmes, the archfey of merit **sits in a chair above the next door. He points to the members of the party that did not sacrifice himself and calls them cowards.
			* People who warned others three times in the previous room are granted pardonand not allowed to partake in bargain for the guilty
			* People who fought to volunteer to die on the spike are granted pardon and not allowed to partake in bargain for the guilty
			* Those who were passive in letting others suffer or die for them during the tower are called out, even if they mourned.
				* "Why did you not offer yourself instead, you muck-fouling piece of shit?"
					* If they do not have an unselfish goal, they are declared guilty
					* If they were cowardly or willing to let others die instead of them they are declared guilty
					* If they have an unselfish goal, they are given the same offer the guilty parties get.
					* They are told that by the powers of **The Gau-Magmes Magistration, they have two choices. They may choose to die in their friend's stead. If they do, their friend is revived, granted the skills and abilities of the person who offers to sacrifice themselves for the revivification. If multiple people are guilty, then they can all choose to make the sacrifice with the ensurance that their quests will be taken up immediately by replacements with better chances of succeeding alongside their friend, who will only only remember their journey with their new friends.**
						* By fey magic they will be granted the titles of the person who dies for them, all rights to rule, and custody of all children born and unborn, as if it was always their right. In the even of an unborn child, a surrogate chosen from among the archfey will bear them until birth and grant them a fey blessing. 
						* Any obstacle that stops a person from offering themselves to die is removed by promise of fey magic
						* People who refuse the bargain are told they are allowed to live, but are Permanently under the effect of the spell Bane, which can only be removed by divine atonement or the use of the //wish //spell. 
					* Those who attempt to attack the court and declare them murderers, declaring injustice are told they could have easily left the room and spared their life. There is no Reward at the end of this tower that should justifies the greed that killed their compatriot who was clearly willing to die for them. Fey attacked in this room appear gaseous and invulnerable to harm. Creatures with truesight will spot them as illusions with the exception of the **Gau-Magmes. **People who were simply caught off guard and did not have time to act or influence the decision of their friend are offered the ability to leave without penalty, but are not allowed to progress further in the tower if they do so.
					* The Gau Magmes is immune to any spell, attack or ability by anyone who is declared guilty
			* The Next room is a banquet that works like heroes feast, Adventurers are allowed to rest here in peace before they continue. People who sacrificed themselves on the spikes are all revived in this room A fey attendant will reveal that all promises of the **Gau-magmes **other than the curse for those who were guilty were **fuckin lies.**
			* The next room is divided in half,  both on the floor and on the ceiling with a small round section in the middle (as well as on the ceiling). upon which is a pedastel with a lever. Once the door is closed the lever can be pulled, and the party hears the words "one side is safe" as the roof on both halves begin to close, descending one foot per round for five rounds from their height of 10 ft ceilings. At the end of the five rounds, the middle section with the lever rises instantly to meet its counterpart in the ceiling, dealing 20d10 damage to anything still standing in the middle. Both of the other sides return to normal  and a staircase emerges leading up ward from the wall on the side opposite of the entrance. 
			* The second last room lies at the end of a 100 foot staircase that circles around the last part of the tower. There is a veil of blackness covering the entrance and nothing can be heard on the other side, nor can characters telepathically communicate through it. Upon entering, an individual is greeted with a completely empty domed room that is featureless and grey like graphite. A small toy puzzle sits in the middle of the room. It cannot leave the room, and solving it does nothing. No configuration of the puzzle does anything. Leaving the room after entering it brings you to the final room, with the **Scion of fire**
			* The last room is the hall of the **Scion of fire, who stands in a glassy pentagramal room that is 120ft tall, and slightly pink with the fire from their head, as well as the nebulae, stars, and galactic formations that seem to float gently by them. The Scion of fire Offers congradulations to those who learned all lessons of the academy.**
				* Stagnation is decay, 
				* the balance between loss and stability is still a loss
				* When all options look the same, try anything
				* When you are faced with impossible decisions, choose anything and know that it is your choice
				* Do the impossible, break the unbreakable
			* The scion of fire is capable of making **Oathbows, as well as staves of the Archmagi, Nine-lives stealers, Rods of lordly might, and other legendary items suited to those who succeed in their challenges, though they will only make one per person. **When people are done talking to the Scion of fire, they are returned to the entrance.

	**The Scion of fire (ENFP) Archfey, (Fighter, Champion 15)**
		This radiant purple humanoid creature embodies the power of determination
			Height: 5'10 on average Their height adjusts to how impressed they are with someone, taller for more.
			Influence: Any check rolled with bardic inspiration or an inspiration die after having failed the same roll previously. 
		Five Skulls, joined in a ring at their cheekbones, coated in a light purple flame. Hovering in front of them is a ring of red glass, with one triangular spike extending upward along the center of each skull, and two other trianglesthat cover each eye extending ourward until they join up with the same pattern on the adjacent skulls. The Lower jaws are all pointed, such that when they are all open, there is no gap in the center.  Thick black metallic bands seem to serve as skin for the neck, upper back, shoulders and arms. For the chest and abdomen of this humanoid creature, A toned and atheletic torso, coated in pinkish-purple transparent skin, revealing the muscles beneath. **The Scion of fire**  wears a ragged set of white pants, undereath which are no genitals, a fact which is only relevent because their pants frequently get destroyed in battle. The rest of their skin is a deeper purple metal. They do not care what you are here for, just that you are here, they do not care what your goal is, just that you have one. They are proud of you for having made it this far. The Scion of fire represents the drive to overcome, the power of determination, the ability to share, and the courage to do all of those things in spite of fear. They Freely give Inspiration die to anyone who visits them.  The scion is immune to damage and all conditions except grappled but cannot do lethal damage to any creature. They invite people to freely test their resolve against their own. To our knowledge, it is not possible to best the scion of fire in this contest, because he feeds on that willpower. For those that endeavour to inspire others to pursue their own goals, the scion of fire grants The boon of Foritude, increasing their maximum HP by 40. For those that challenge him in combat and perform admirably, they earn the boon of the fire soul, granting them immunity to fire damage and the ability to cast burning hands at will (dc 15) without consuming spell slots or needing components. Those who cast other spells that deal fire damage that get the boon of fire can now, without using an action, change the damage of their fire spells to lightning. All spells of theirs that deal fire damage now ignore resistance to fire as the fire burns significantly hotter and a colour of their choice.

He does not have feet but instead walks on two closed fists with cracked skin  from where they have been walking. He casts from a cobra stafff if he needs to. His voice is bitter and surprisingly smooth. His intonation is filled with stocatto on his consonants, and he smells of cinnamon and sulfur.
