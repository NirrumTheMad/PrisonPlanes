====== The Court of whispers ======
Created Saturday 15 August 2020

Tucked in the nightways and moonlit parts of the feywild, behind  Sprawling thin-branched trees is the realm of the court of whispers. The complexes that house the fey here are suited to their myriad plots and schemes and plans.

==== The Library of Lies ====
	The library of lies is a maze of woven Cypress trees and filled with tomes, scrolls, books, tablets, and other strange media for recording history. However, nothing in the library of lies is functionally true. It is a record **of** lies, told by either the fey or the people they manipulate. They keep extensive track and keep all of their stories documented so they can build up great catastrophes or spurts of growth as they choose. If you find a lie in this library, you are then certain that it is a lie that was told, these are annotated in the event that the lies are accidentally true.  The library lies within a stageroad, so there is always light by which to read. The Library is kept by The **Horachibald, **the Archfey of Sinister Knowledge
	
	**The Horachibald (ISTJ) **Court of Whispers, Archfey, (Fey sorcerer, whispers, 9)
		This mossy-backed warden does not appreciate undocumented lies in the library
			Height: 10'2
			Influence: 19 Deception (intelligence), A web of falsehoods that create no less that 12 paradoxes that seem to be solved within the falsehoods but aren't is enough to confound this one.
		A Triagular, deer-like cycloptic skull sports a single baleful lidless yellow eye upon its forehead. Upon this skull ther eis no skin, there are  no lips around the grinning,  toothy, mouth that sits tucked against the being's neck. Two long 8even-fingered (and a thumb) hands sit at the ends of very long forearms, clad in teal, clammy skin. The forearms attach to a slightly shorter length of upper arm which is anchored somewhere behind the thick mat of moss that constitutes the creature's body. The Horachibald carries a lantern on the end of a long scythe-like staff, with a gnarled but rather direct jut of wood where the blade would be. A small grinning pixie is chained to the staff and holds up the lantern in its hands. The Horachibald is the only entity in the library of lies that is not highlighted by the stageroad lights. If someone climbs to the top of the shelves and stacks of the library, one can usually spot the staff of the Horachibald as it wanders. The Horachibald is helpful, but cautious. For every question asked of the Horachibald, the demanded return is immediate, "Why do you want to know? And No lying". The Horachibald's voice is somewhat deep but silky and without vocal fry. It smells of autumn forest, of wet rotting leaves and lifeless limbs. The Breath of the Horachibald is chilly, and delivers an impression that one should hurry with their tasks to prepare for winter.
			

==== The Mistaken Well ====
	This pool of ink is filled with liquid illusion magic, the sort that jolts a mind. The fey use this to craft mistakes and flaws when they need to.  The thin, oily liquid tricks the senses, any sense, into being wrong. The power of the stuff is weak, but it does not need to be strong if it is well applied. It can also be used as a splendid indigo pigment, which, strangely seems blue in sunlight, but purple in most artificial lights. This does not appear to a be a magical property. The Well is guarded by **The Weyser rybe, **The Archfey of sluggishness
	
	**The Weyser Rybe (ENFJ) **Whispers, Archfey (Behir stats, breath weapon induces sleep instead, see spell)
		Length: 22'6
		Influence:: 13 Sleight of Hand (Wisdom) A quick check of your own thoughts will catch the rybe  within them as it messes about.
	The Weyser Rybe is a long, thick, snake-like entity, who bears a clam instead of a head. The eyes of the clam glow and change color as the Weyser Rybe communicates,. The Scales of the Weyser rybe are blue, with regular brown spots in two pairs of two lines on either side of its back. Its belly scales are black. When the Rybe attacks, a harpoon-like spike emerges from the clamshell along with two pincer-like mandibles for pulling things onto the spike. The Rybe speaks in a deep, masculine voice but if the voice is loud enough, the echo will be feminine. The Weyser Rybe Requires a favour in order to allow outsiders to take from the mistaken well, but that favour must be a favour from another fey, what the Weyser Rybe will do with it, it will never reveal if unbound. If the Weyser Rybe is bound, it will reveal that it uses these favours to attack other plots to disrupt them

==== The Ambition Chiller ====
	This cave is adorned with long rods of glass cylinders  extending parallel to eachother inside  of a loing corridor. Nestled between the rods, held into place by adhesive, are droplets of enchantment magic based oil. This thick and sticky tar like substance is tansparent and yellowish. This goop is a blend of shadowfell and feywild magics (see Amona Tailyudur)  and produce ample distractions and cause important things to seem to cost more energy to do.  The Ambition chiller is guarded by The **Gassure**, who happens to be exceptionally good at obscuring even advanced divinations. The Gassure is the Archfey of Sedation
	
	** The Gassure (INTP) **Whispers, Archfey (Wizard Enchantment 14)
		This six-winged, four armed, blue chitinous humanoid is extremely tenacious in its efforts to go unnoticed.
			Height: 5'5
			Influence: 27 Sleight of hand (wisdom), to think of something else, to be distracted, and then notice when the Gassure's Guard is down. And god damn it are they tenacious. One has disadvantage on the check if The Gassure knows you're going to try.

==== The Whisper's Toyshop ====
	A thick and tall building bursting through several layers of the feywild, aglow with candlelight, this mishmash of workshops is where whisper fey go to build prodigies. This great workship is home to some masterful workers, mostly specializing in toys. As works of the fey, they are imbued with fey magic. A Whispers fey will use these toys to sneak ideas into sleeping children. Ideas of ambition, rebellion, passivity, or the perpetual singing of muses. Only a child can hear the works coming from their toys, and of course, they'll always think it's in their head. Great heroes are often the product of whisper fey plots, as are many villains, and many of both are cultivated from birth, shaped to become what they do. The Whisper's toyshop is watched over by **The Master Bellman,** The Archfey of Unintended influences**. The Ringing of his bell is very very dangerous, especially to fey,**
	
	**The Master Bellman **(INFJ) Whispers Archfey (Artificer 5, Fey Tome Int-Warlock 5)
		Height: 4'0
		Influence: 25 Investigation (Charisma), to recognize his plots as they worm into one's head  is easy on paper, but requires focus in practice.
	A hunched old man-elf with a long beard and thick round spectacles covering their solid ruby eyes, The Master Bellman has a tall symmetrical staff capped with an unstrung lyre. Where the strings would be, a bell is hung instead. When the bell is rung, all creatures that hear it must make a DC20 Charisma save or owe the Bellman a favour. He wears a green jacket over a wine-coloured robe. His shoes are heavily curled at the toes, of course. He does not require favours from people unless they disrupt the library, and he uses the favours he gets to persuade bards to tell certain stories with the promises of fey magic
	

==== Amona Taliyudur, the castle of whispers ====
	Subtly hidden in the bleakest morning of the feywild, in a white foggy plain, there is a castle of grey stone, not too different in hue from the fog. It stands with two visible towers  on the nightward side of the structure. It has no doors, no sewers, and attempts to fly into it, despite it clearly having an open courtyard, will yield only a shift into a different part of the feywild. A favour is required to get in at all. and that favour must be from the door itself. The door, being unable to think, is not capable of giving out favours, thus, the only way into the castle is to, by some magic, //forge a favour from the door, or alternatetively, be invited inside by the Archfey of Whispers themselves. //Getting into the halls of this castle is, in either case, putting onesself in great danger, as you are automatically included in the plots of the Archfey. Hallways may stretch into eternity, A dinner may take forever to eat, you might go to sleep in a bed and never wake up. This is the easiest place to get lost completely in the fey. To enter this rather gothic castle is to be certain that you will be put away until you are the most use to the master of the castle. **Caelmet Greshane is the NAME **of the archfey of Whispers, or at least, the name we've been given. They answer to it at least, but are not bound by it in any capacity, meaning they either have a stockpile of backups of their name, or some poor fey is doing their best to live without. 
	
		**Caelmet Greshane, (INTJ) Archfey and ruler of the court of whispers, (Patron, Fey)**
			Height: 5'2
			Influence: 30 Persuasion (charisma), You must tell them where your plot lies within theirs
		The Form that Caelmet Greshane takes is that of a naked, hermaphroditic humanoid of extremely fair features. They have six gemlike dragonfly wings, four arms, and pale lavender eyes, their skin is usually extremely pale and their hair usually white as well. They are not limited to this form, and this information is certainly also part of their plots. Caelmet Greshane is known to grant favours readily and willingly and makes for a handy patron, but be rest assured, they make out better in the deal than anyone they deal with. Caelmet is not evil, but is uncaring for common plights. They delight in building up massive civilizations in order to screw over a single person. That person, alone and broken, is taken by the whispers fey to Amona taliyudur, where they are kept in Crystals of Regret, there, they slowly fade, their essence dripping through fey pipes and into the ambition chiller. Siofra spawned by Caelmet tend to share their lavender eyes. Caelmet has many children, and it can be certain that willing, knowing, not or neither, they are part of the Archfey's schemes. 
		
		**The Uuduroshi (ESTP) Archfey of Dice (Patron, Fey)**
			Height: 32ft
			Influence: 27 Perception (wisdom) You must notice them cheating to bind them. A deception (dexterity)  27 has the same effect, a subtle change in body language to indicate that you know they cheated
		The Uudurosh is a gargantuan and muscular creature, with short bluish-green fur covering a  femalish body, She binds her chest  with wrappings and wears plate armor on her legs.  Her face is Humanoid,  with deep laugh lines and sharp teeth. The skin around her face bears little fur and is very grey with a slight hint of tan. Her eyes are always wild and regardless of the rest of the face's position, seem to imply hunger.  Her favours appear to be given out as gambling losses but, as per usual, the Archfey of dice never loses except on purpose. She has no and intends to bear no offspring, but she has thousands of warlocks who earn their lessons by "losing" her dice in places they visit, by gambling, playing games, or by enticing others to do so. Any money lost on this gambling is to be considered payment, any money won is to be considered a tip. She will not hesitate to eat someone who displeases her, but she is known to boast and is prideful and easily swayed by flattery, even lies. 
		
		**The Sha-Malnui (INFP) Archfey of Secrets (Patron, Fey)**
			Length: 1 mile
			Influence: 10 Intelligence (history), made with advantage. You must tell them something that you truly think only you witnessed
		The Sha-Malnui is  a continuous shadow that reaches out from Amona Taliyudur. they do not have a form other than shadow. The Sha-Malnui is extremely helpful, and simply gathers otherwise unknown things within their depths. Once a secret is within the sha-malnui, it will leak into the mind of someone who could have known but didn't, or who could have found out, often as a flashback memory, but sometimes as discovering a clue. The Sha-Malnui has no siofra, and often shares their patronage with knowledge domain clerics. They offer their patronage in exchange for secret knowledge, the juicier, the better, for it can be certain that despite being so helpful, the Sha-malnui is one of the most well-informed fey and still a member of the court of whispers
