====== The Court of Terror ======
Created Monday 24 August 2020





**The Enamel Scale** (INFJ) Court of Terror, Fey Snake/Mirage Dragon, (Green dragon Wyrmling stats, minus fly speed + a fear/hallucination skill?)
Height, or more accurately length: 45 ft
Influence: 18 Medicine (Wisdom), you must identify the wisdom teeth among the scales
Description: A giant snake, scaled in teeth, with opaque solid pink eyes, which resides in a circular pool of water, who’s surface is never disturbed, regardless of what falls in or touches it. Her scales are patterned ever so slightly, similar to those of an albino ball python, with yellow and white teeth alternating to form the pattern. Her own teeth are a collection of mammalian carnivore teeth. The pool floor itself is littered in cast-off blackened, rotted teeth, though the pool is never clouded by the muck. Humanoids who still have their wisdom teeth when they encounter her owe the serpent a favour, however they can annul it by offering the teeth up.



==== Cauldrona Canyon ====
	Entering this canyon is a spiritual journey, as many places in the feywild are. It is one of the few places where 90 degree angles get you their expected results.  The Canyon is the work of a being called **Gran-nan, **who is the **Archfey of Old Traumas. **The Cauldrona Canyon is only a mile long and filled with magical Rain. The rain falls in thick blots that obscure any form of vision, hearing, tremorsense or blindsight, limiting it to 20ft before nearly all meaning is lost, other than points of bright light, which can be seen for up to 100 ft.  **Gran-nan **guards, or rather, lives next to **The hole in your dreams.** A stone Dias next to **Gran-nan's House** marks the location of the hole. The rain never falls on the dias, and if one looks upward, the hole in the clouds reveals an inky black abyss. Staring into, listening for, attempting to smell, or reaching for the hole reveals the exact location of all major elements of each individuals own worst memories in their most consistent form. The person who killed one's parents, the corpse of a spider that crawled across one's face, the house one was born in, the house one died in, the house one left part of themselves behind and what remains of that. The parts of the memory can be explored and selected. The less horrible the memory, the less clear it is. This interaction can instantly cure and repair Retrograde //and// Anterograde amnesia, among other long-term memory disorders, curses, and spells. A person can choose one feature of their memory, even obscure or metaphysical aspects and be given a clear and understandable location. If there are special instructions required to enter a location, the map will provide one option, though not necessarily how to achieve it. It is not cryptic, but it does not solve problems. A specific pattern of actions required to unlock a spell is easy, but the response to getting to a floating island is simply "fly". The memory of this location and these instructions remains permanently clear so long as nothing interferes with the memory of the trauma which also remains clear and so long as the object or concept is present in a meaningful form. 
	
	
	
	**The Cauldrona Experience:**
		within a few moments of entering the canyon safely, the party will first smell rotting and putrefying flesh, 
		As they progress, the source of the smell becomes apparent, a large elk-like creature lies with most but not all of its pure white fur eaten away, exposing its flesh. 
			its eyes, which are on the sides of its head are permanently open with one of them staring at the party. The same side of its face has been chewed away revealing its row of sharp teeth, Something black drips from its lips (it's tar)
			It is writhing very visibly with maggots, which begin hissing if the party comes close at all. If anyone comes even closer, the maggots begin crying, a sound not unlike human children
			If the party interacts with the corpse in any way, the body thrashes, then stands up, lets out a pained bleat  and runs off into the rain with a movespeed of 60, and it uses its dash. 180t later it slams its head into a wall, dashing its brains on a stone and continues to attempt this if stopped.
		As the path progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the cliff walls that line the canyon contain fossilized children of many races en masse, some of them reach out from the wall, their tiny hands skeletonized. Among the children's skeletons, are larger, giant skeletons of horrible proportions. Many of the smaller skeletons lie  where the guts would have been in these larger ones
			Against one wall there is a fully adult hand reaching out from the shoulder of a barely visible infantile skeleton barely hidden behind translucent stone. The hand is fresh and a backpack and bedroll are on the ground. If disturbed, cockroaches erupt from both and scatter, often remaining hidden among the party's belongings (attaching to an item and remaining imperceptible until that item is inspected or used)
		Along the centre of the canyon, a solid, uninterrupted and uniform strip of stone serves as a path emerging from stony rubble, a ditch with muddy water flows alongside. Drinking the water gives one a rather acidic and metallic taste. Should anyone spit out the water, a small black tadpole attempts to squirm back into the river, where it becomes undetectable, a faint smell of smoke is on the wind.
			shortly after the road begins, sheltered under a tree are three fresh elven bodies, one with a mutilated face that is lacerated with glass around the destroyed maxilla, one lying down writhing with black tadpoles that crawl out from holes all over their skin, in particular around their face which is unrecognizable from the holes which never seem to overlap, and one kneeling over it with a shortword buried in their stomach. From the wound of the kneeling elf, more black tadpoles writhe and as the party looks, their eye erupts and another tadpole falls out onto the ground, trying to squirm toward the river. There are four bedrolls and four adventurer's kits on the ground. Their fire is still smouldering, their wood too wet to catch in its current state. 
		The road-like strip stops abruptly with a change of elevation, with the ground rising quickly nearly 4 feet. A nearly perfect round pit sinks into the ground. The pit has no known bottom. around the pit is a steep clay bank, about three feet  high. The pit is easy to avoid but one can't look *down* the pit any signficant distance without being on the crumbly slope. There is a DC 5 Acrobatics check to not slip  and a DC 5 Athletics check to not fall in after slipping. A character that falls in the hole is stuck there without aid from something that can fall faster than it does or something that can teleport.
			Behind the top of the  rise, A sleepy goat rests. If a character climbs the ledge, the goat panics and attacks the character in a surprise round (provided it is not already spotted), trying to use its charge attack. Instead of knocking the player prone, the goat pushes them toward (and if possible into) the pit, where they make the same saves described above. A character that is unaware of the goat that gets a higher initiative gets advantage on the save.
			If the goat gets killed and doesn't fall down the hole, maggots quickly begin working their way onto its skin.
			If no one is looking at the pit, a scuffing sound can be heard followed by a feminine scream that quickly fades, as if something had fallen in. A broken foot-long campfire skewer rests on the bank of the pit.
		After the elevation change and goat there is a massive, reddish black pond that lines the canyon from wall to wall. The water is cold, dark, and ripples from the rain obscure the surface. The pond is 150ft across. Swimming through the pond isn't spectacularly difficult but a constitution check with a DC of 10 is required to avoid gaining exhaustion. Visibility is low in the water, about 3ft maximum. The pond is 50ft deep at its deepest points, the bottom a mixe of white rocks and slimy mud
			If the characters choose to swim, halfway across, one member must make a DC 15 athletics check or be pulled under the water's surface. Another Athletics check or Any damage at all to the thing grabbing them will free them. If they are unable to free themselves, they begin drowning in 1d10 rounds, and will go unscious after an additional 1d4, three rounds after which, they die. At the bottom of the reed pulling them down, is a round, wide face with round, small-pupiled eyes and a thick-lipped, wide toothy smile. Upon inspection, it is a mask. The Mask, if retrieved, is painted wood and cursed, and the character permanently loses the ability to recognize faces as faces seeing them instead as the grotesque, knobbly and not infrequently pallid mounds of claylike flesh they are. Any form of Pareidolia ceases for that creature, and while they will be able to recognize the part of a creature that is a face, it will always feel alien and out of place. A Greater restoration or Remove curse spell removes this effect permanently from the cursed creature. 
			If the characters choose to fly over the lake, A flash of ligthning reveals that the entire lakebed is in the same shape as the mask mentioned above. At this point, flying characters will notice some of the raindrops are actually black tadpoles
		Shortly after the pond, a dense but relatively short  forest  starts. Upon the evenly spaced trees are apples. The apples inevitably all have Tawny worms in them. At the base of many of the trees are writhing matts of worms, feasting on apples.
			The apples are relatively bitter with only a mild sweetness, they are quite astringent and dry out one's mouth.
			Underneath the matts of the worms are occasional bones of varying sizes but no sign of equipment
		Behind this orchard is A long, single-floored wooden house in a rough L-shape. This is The House of **The Wizened Grannard, **the archfey of old trauma. She is always friendly, perhaps too friendly, and will offer travellers applejack, a sour alcoholic beverage made from distilled apples, With her are a crowd of children of different races. After speaking with the players for a few sentences, **Gran-nan ** asks the children to go sit in the basket they want to be in. When they are all settled in, she turns all of the children standing tightly together in each basket into **either black tadpoles, tawny worms, or pale white maggots. **She will then ask the travellers if they want to help her bring the tadpoles to the pond, as she can get the worms herself, and the maggots always seem to know their own way. She will explain with a toothless smile that all of the wriggling things in the canyon are lost children. Until they decide to die, leave, or until someone comes to pick them up, they can live in this canyon eternally, in cool rains, abundant apples, and without much fear of things that can eat them. 
		**The only thing that can enter the canyon and harm the children are sapient, thinking creatures, and browsing herbivores that are nearing death.**
			If any of the wriggling thigns has been eaten, Gran-nan sighs but smiles. "There are so many here, It is inevitable that some of them die. I hope you chewed well though, Children are tough, and sometimes a half a child can become two full ones and those rascals are always hungry, you know how children are." She then laughs a wicked laugh. 
			Gran nan changes the children into small things to save on space, as she has millions in her care
			Gran nan says that you can only take out the child meant to go with you.
			Gran nan reveals the walls  of the canyon are hungry too, and have their own guardians to protect the children, the giants who eat wayward adults who tarry too long in the canyon.
			Gran nan offers guidance in her limited capacity, and when the party wishes to leave, she'll draw a short door with a piece of chalk on the wall of her hut. She'll then stick in a branch or spoon or some sort  of crook that can be turned and open the door, revealing the entryway to one of the buildings in one of the other courts, a much more welcoming place. She says that the door isn't a very good one, it doesn't like to open a second time. She will absolutely give away a single piece of chalk as a gift, which can link any two places that the player has been, provided that they have been invited and that at some point in both places, they felt comfortable. The door can only open once, after which the chalk is nonmagical....unless they want to become a wriggling thing too. A player can draw with the chalk anywhere if they wish to visit  Gran-nan again.
			**Gran-nan claims to know nothing of the roaches, they shouldn't be able to get into the valley at all. She'll have to go look later.**

		


			

	
	**The Wizened Grannard, or Gran-nan (ISFP) **archfey
	A tiny humanoid woman with a squat face and Cinnamon-colored skin that guards lost children... perhaps
		height: 4'0
		Influence: 11 Arcana (charisma) to show her that you can at least wiggle your soul a bit. 
	The Wizened Grannard is an undeniably skilled witch. Her eyes are not visible in their sockets, as the skin from her face simply seems to have engulfed them, leaving the thinnest of slits to indicate that she does indeed have eye sockets, if not eyes. She has No teeth and wears a simple brown robe. Her voice is crackly with vocal fry and high pitched. She Gives good life advice but in a macabre way, usually adding parts on to advice that imply that not taking that course of action would be Catastrophic or lethal. "Yes yes, always use your manners when speaking to pretty men, They'll be more likely to talk, and you won't have your tongue stolen by a Wusslebarg." "You should get your armour oiled or it'll rust and squeak and then one of the skulks will find you and steal your soul and face so they can trick others into making the same mistake."
	If attacked, she disappears completely with a cackle, leaving a pile of empty clothes on the floor and her hut silent. She will never appear again to those that witness this.
