====== The Court Of Swords ======
Created Sunday 23 August 2020

Along the shores of one of the fey oceans, often ducking in and out of it, are the most common places to find the facilities of the court of swords. Seasons pass exceptionally quickly in the Sword lands, though time often seems to stand completely still

==== The Temple Spa of the Rigid Baron ====
	Carved into the steep slope of of a short mountain range  covered in rigid coniferous trees  that flower in bright Lilly-like flowers  when magic is cast nearby is a orange-and-grey temple that from which rises many plumes of steam. The mountains face a bay in the late afternoon fey. The crescent mouthed bay hold grey waters that are around 17 celcius. The wind that blows up the mountain is cool and bracing. The temple is composed of many parts. The main hall, where a statue of the rigid baron overlooks wrestlers, acrobats, and on occasion, some other, rather masochistic practices, such as fey sitting in sconces. Behind the main hall are hot springs, fed by the boiling falls, and cold falls, fed by the freezing spring. Here, any injury can be healed. With the permission of the Rigid Baron, Any being can have their shape remade within the scope of their power.  For fey, this requires favour, for non-fey, this requires hard work maintaining the temple equal in experience to half of the mortal's life so far, Thankfully, where this is the feywild, that doesn't take long.  There are many stone meditation platforms where folk can go to become inspired, to reflect, or to exercise. **The Rigid Baron** is the keeper of the temple spa and its abbot and head trainer, as well as **The archfey of biomechanical structure. **

He is green if viewd from above and sunrise pink if viewed from below.  His face is the face of an axolotl but with a Large sweeping moustache. He wears only a black and gold kilt and leather sandals. THE RIGID BARON  likes to test the resolve of people who ask for his help by challenging them to a wrestling match.

The Rigid baron uses their favours to force people to use their strength, physical or mental.
		

==== The Hall of Moments ====
	In a seaside cave on the edge of a harsh ocean an octagonal tower stands.It has three floors but seems to grow more as you approach it and usually less as you move away. The Tower's walls are Red with pink and metallic green streaks. The Doors are a set of curtains that are very heavy but will flutter under the lightest breath. Inside the tower Is a series of rooms that show people singular moments or allow them breif, ephemeral experiences. Upon entering the tower, one finds that there is onyl one floor with one corridor that branches into 3 after 1/3d it's length. The circular windows never seem to show the same outside, but other areas of the feywild (which one can travel through, should one leave through the window. The windows can be entered through but it is considered rude). Each room holds a powerful enchantment built by the fey working within. Once you enter, you experience the moment, and then it slowly fades. Love, fear, Agony, Ambedo, Loss, jubilation, thrill, Dysphoria, Sonder, Occhiolism,. Each enchantment's form comes with an illusion, what you see when it grabs you. On occasion, Manaharahi Therapists will visit this tower with their patients to help them face trauma or to experience something they usually don't. You cannot be physically forced into any room in the hall, The doors will not open if you don't want them to when you grasp the handle. The Illusion that comes with each enchantment is unique to the person experiencing it. The Hall of moments is tended to and overseen by **The Gogg (or Gogue)**, who is also the archfey of hearts (metaphorically. To our knowledge, none of the archfey hold any extra power over actual viscera, save one). A water channel runs through this tower, and it is said to either feed into or derive from the river styx, following the flow has been an exercise in futility though.
	
		**The Gogg (ESFJ) Swords **Archfey, (Fey Magic Sorcerer 10)
			This strange pinkish Orange Flower grows rapidly  when it needs to speak  and withers to a crawling rhizome when it does not
				Height: max 5ft
				Influence: 4 History (charisma) Recall a moving moment that will impress this creature, it does not need to be from your own life
			The Gogg is a moving flowerbed  that simply grows //in// the direction it's headed and withers in the direction it's coming from. The Gogg his violently opposed to people not experiencing things and will constantly try to enchant or illude people who are avoiding facing their own emotions. The Gogg is notoriously nosy and petty, moreso than one would expect. The gogg is easily swayed however, appeals to emotion nearly always work on it, even if they are ludicrious propositions. Despite this, they will use their full power to prevent people from damaging the hall, and we've not been able to quantify what it takes to stop them. It is suspected the hall itself has some sort of life or power.
