====== The Court Of Swords ======
Created Sunday 23 August 2020

Along the shores of one of the fey oceans, often ducking in and out of it, are the most common places to find the facilities of the court of swords. Seasons pass exceptionally quickly in the Sword lands, though time often seems to stand completely still

==== The Temple Spa of the Rigid Baron ====
	Carved into the steep slope of of a short mountain range  covered in rigid coniferous trees  that flower in bright Lilly-like flowers  when magic is cast nearby is a orange-and-grey temple that from which rises many plumes of steam. The mountains face a bay in the late afternoon fey. The crescent mouthed bay hold grey waters that are around 17 celcius. The wind that blows up the mountain is cool and bracing. The temple is composed of many parts. The main hall, where a statue of the rigid baron overlooks wrestlers, acrobats, and on occasion, some other, rather masochistic practices, such as fey sitting in sconces. Behind the main hall are hot springs, fed by the boiling falls, and cold falls, fed by the freezing spring. Here, any injury can be healed. With the permission of the Rigid Baron, Any being can have their shape remade within the scope of their power.  For fey, this requires favour, for non-fey, this requires hard work maintaining the temple equal in experience to half of the mortal's life so far, Thankfully, where this is the feywild, that doesn't take long.  There are many stone meditation platforms where folk can go to become inspired, to reflect, or to exercise. **The Rigid Baron** is the keeper of the temple spa and its abbot and head trainer, as well as **The archfey of biomechanical structure. **
	
		**THE RIGID BARON (ENFP) Swords, Archfey (Fighter,  unarmed fighting Samurai 12)**
			Height: Equal to the height of the person they last spoke to
			Influence: 19 Athletics (constitution) withstand a mighty fistbump with the core of your soul
		THE RIGID BARON is a Muscular humanoid of masculine figure, firm hands, and skin that is golden if he is viewed from the back, Blue if he is viewed from the front, ruby red if viewed from the right and bright purple if viewed from the left. He is green if viewd from above and sunrise pink if viewed from below.  His face is the face of an axolotl but with a Large sweeping moustache. He wears only a black and gold kilt and leather sandals. THE RIGID BARON  likes to test the resolve of people who ask for his help by challenging them to a wrestling match. The outcome of the match is irrelevant to the baron though, simply that they showed their resolve by fighting well. The Rigid baron uses their favours to force people to use their strength, physical or mental. The rigid baron has a gargantuan greatsword that he can summon and weild without penalty as a bonus action, but only does so in the most dire of situations
		

==== The Hall of Moments ====
	In a seaside cave on the edge of a harsh ocean an octagonal tower stands.It has three floors but seems to grow more as you approach it and usually less as you move away. The Tower's walls are Red with pink and metallic green streaks. The Doors are a set of curtains that are very heavy but will flutter under the lightest breath. Inside the tower Is a series of rooms that show people singular moments or allow them breif, ephemeral experiences. Upon entering the tower, one finds that there is onyl one floor with one corridor that branches into 3 after 1/3d it's length. The circular windows never seem to show the same outside, but other areas of the feywild (which one can travel through, should one leave through the window. The windows can be entered through but it is considered rude). Each room holds a powerful enchantment built by the fey working within. Once you enter, you experience the moment, and then it slowly fades. Love, fear, Agony, Ambedo, Loss, jubilation, thrill, Dysphoria, Sonder, Occhiolism,. Each enchantment's form comes with an illusion, what you see when it grabs you. On occasion, Manaharahi Therapists will visit this tower with their patients to help them face trauma or to experience something they usually don't. You cannot be physically forced into any room in the hall, The doors will not open if you don't want them to when you grasp the handle. The Illusion that comes with each enchantment is unique to the person experiencing it. The Hall of moments is tended to and overseen by **The Gogg (or Gogue)**, who is also the archfey of hearts (metaphorically. To our knowledge, none of the archfey hold any extra power over actual viscera, save one). A water channel runs through this tower, and it is said to either feed into or derive from the river styx, following the flow has been an exercise in futility though, as it often disappears underneath roots or falls around corners that are not intuitive to navigate. **The Gogg** grants favour for one dreamless night, in which the gogg raids one's memories for the most potent feelings a person has ever felt and their context, causing a level of exhaustion the next day. For favours, **The Gogg** is willing to teach the spells "plant growth" and "spike growth" to any class that does not use wisdom as their casting modifier. To warlocks, **The Gogg** is willing to teach eldritch blast, which takes the form of long vines with curved knives for leaves. For anyone else, **The Gogg** can make slippers (or other footwear) of spider climb that also cause one's hair to smell of citrus when cut.
	
		**The Gogg (ESFJ) Swords **Archfey, (Fey Magic Sorcerer 10)
			This strange pinkish Orange Flower grows rapidly  when it needs to speak  and withers to a crawling rhizome when it does not
				Height: max 5ft
				Influence: 4 History (charisma) Recall a moving moment that will impress this creature, it does not need to be from your own life
			The Gogg is a moving flowerbed  that simply grows //in// the direction it's headed and withers in the direction it's coming from. The Gogg his violently opposed to people not experiencing things and will constantly try to enchant or illude people who are avoiding facing their own emotions. The Gogg is notoriously nosy and petty, moreso than one would expect. The gogg is easily swayed however, appeals to emotion nearly always work on it, even if they are ludicrious propositions. Despite this, they will use their full power to prevent people from damaging the hall, and we've not been able to quantify what it takes to stop them. It is suspected the hall itself has some sort of life or power. The Gogg  can grow a seedpod as a bonus action that at the start of the next turn drops a dancing rapier. 
			

	

==== The Corori Cloud Formation ====
	Sitting in the center of one of the fey oceans is a fog bank. should one attempt, they will find that they are able to //walk on this cloud. //The gentle slope  continues upward for what feels like a few minutes but looking backward shows the journey to be impossibly long. At this point the cloud takes on the shape of a thunderhead made out of trees, with their massive canopy eclipsing hundreds of impossible thin trunks, through which sunlight  streams through. Thunder can be heard through the trees but it always seems to be far off. The smell of ozone and seabreeze without the taint of wrack is omnipresent and the breeze is soft and cool, but not cold. Parties will find themselves Constantly bombarded by sensation, They'll notice rocks in their shoes, they'll notice their hair as it touches their head,  and their clothes as they shift and move as they walk. Characters who succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw will begin to notice fey around them, invisbile to others. The humming of wings, the patter of feet, occasionally a white and pink face with abormally large eyes disappearing behind a tree with a giggle.  Characters who notice this are assaulted from all angles by various weapons. The weapons all roll with a +1 to hit once per round. If one of them hits a character that has noticed them, they are reduced to 1hp and are able to gain Audience with **The Sel'Evi. **The Archfey of mental tranquility and awareness is a compassionate creature and grants those that are able to visit him a permanent +10 to their passive perception. **The Sel'evi **is also capable of granting other senses in exchange for favour. He is also willing to grant favour to a creature that performs an action that snaps a creature out of a state of illusion or madness swiftly, Such as a well-timed punch to someone who is panicking. For such a deed, the **Sel'evi **is willing to grant truesight that works so long as the eye is not exposed to sunlight, Tremorsense that works so long as the feet are touching the ground  but fails if they ever touch linen or wool, or darkvision, each out to the extent of a person's normal range of sight (24km on a clear day). If someone gets **three natural 20 rolls in a row** and one of these rolls is a perception check, the **Sel'Evi**, bolstered with the power, can make this ability permanent upon visiting them afterward.


	**Sel'evi DISTRACTION AND ENLIGHTENMENT**
	dude, shaggy curly hair, skin is some type of pale but I don't think it's completely white, slightly big nose, don't think he has ears? might be the whole cloud formation
	


==== Exquisite Terraces ====
	Where one of the stageroads meets a seaside bluff somewhere along the sunset side of the crepuscular line, there is a set of stagest without setting reaching out over a cliff edge. Their polished yellow would marred only by a few gouges in the wood that heal slowly. Lit by lanterns that burn with white fire which spills out around the edges of the casing. The white fire's light barely reaches off of the stages, where piles of bones and corpses are stacked high. The eyes of these fallen seem to follow the people that walk the stageroad.  At the end of the road where it becomes a wooden cliff, stands **Garsusanla, the Archfey of wounds. **They are one of the rare fey that uses their actual name instead of a title. Garsusanla can offer aid in combat to anyone who is able to deal large amounts of damage to him. **Garsusanla's **name is harder to use than other fey names. In terms of power it is ponderous and gargantuan. **Garsusanla** knows this, and is able to use their name freely because no one can really take it, and anyone who can will inevitably make him more powerful. **Garsusanla **is aware of the conditions that it takes to destroy any creature, and is effectively capable of seeing ability scores, saving throws, initiative, and HP, among other details.
