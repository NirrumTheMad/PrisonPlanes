**Title 3: Konian Military**

	The remains of the Konian military is barely held together by surviving commanders who have to politically scheme in order to remain supported by taxes from Konia's Outlier colonies now that Konia itself is but a shell of what it once was **5854: Not Even a Shell.**
	But people loyal to the old crown, or people loyal to Konia's people still sign on with the military, both for coin, social advancement, vengeance, and the promise of a way to vent frustration.
	
	//**Guildhall**//
		There is no singular guildhall for the Konian Military, but the Home of its navy is in topside Cer-mina, and Barracks exist in every town within its traditionally taxed territory from Mokoi Tha'am to the Ysterports to Quire. Previously the greater walls of Konia were lined with such forts and towers, but after the war of ants, most of those are rubble.
	//**Memberships**//
	Generals, Knights, commanders
	
	//**Allies**//
		No specific force is allied with the remains of the Konian Military
	//**Enemies**//
		**The Kholirahi Army** agresses the northern territories, enslaving the entire north coast, now named the coast of ruins. 
		**Manaharahi Military** groups also caused the near complete destruction of Konia's capital and the majority of its military outposts in the south. **5854: Not even a shell**
		**Monsters. **Oh god, so many monsters
