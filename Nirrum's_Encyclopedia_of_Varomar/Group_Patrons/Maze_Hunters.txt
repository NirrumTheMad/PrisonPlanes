Created Sunday 15 October 2023


**Title 3: Example group**
	In 2672, Shang Lai, the archetypal member of the school of Irrevocable Death, built the danzuishanese maze. The maze funnels magic into it from the far realm, acting as a giant net to catch things that would fall on a massive section of the plane, from part of the aegis, the entire Gannaga region, part of the sea of endless rain, and part of the great grass road. Snarl's most treasured posession, people, often find themselves trapped in the maze. It was not long before adventurers established a guild, and then, the maze hunters, built to find both the greatest (and often other valuable forms) of treasures.
