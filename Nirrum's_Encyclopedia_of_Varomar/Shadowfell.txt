====== Shadowfell ======
Created Wednesday 06 October 2021

The sublime lands of the shadowfell are often portrayed as those of indiscriminate evil, for like the lands of the fey, it is shaped in part by the same forces that shape the material plane's collective consciousnesses, and fear is a powerful tool there indeed. But it is not all so, and much of the shadowfell is built on the more powerful states of being, beyond life and death, as the connected subliminal understanding of the world pervades all.
