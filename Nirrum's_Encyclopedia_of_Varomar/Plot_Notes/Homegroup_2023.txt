The song:
	Perhaps the opening, Piano and harps, a journey to blackwater at some point

	Lone cello of sublime power, the snare of of boots, Resonant carnyx call of conflict.
	Lap steel guitar of threat, power not yet tapped. 
	These people are not powerless. Discongruity lie within how I percieve want.
	Dear sister has given me the answer: the voice, screaming chanting, singing, crying: Find their flaws
	
	the verse of Greed sings the choir
		a singlet viol drones of the great staff of the godking
		the locust rubbing of a bowed quartet of the heist required to raid Dwallat
		glass armonica accompanied by glockenspiel, the glimmer in the depths
