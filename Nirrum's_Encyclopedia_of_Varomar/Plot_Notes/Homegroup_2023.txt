====== Homegroup 2023 ======
Created Monday 07 August 2023

Goal of the story:
Kill Moseie, Orsithach, Establish at least one new country, Supress the cult, Visit the feywild, set up new villains, partially set up recovery of lost Manaharahi and Konian 
Make use of homebrew items, make use of homebrew classes, Make use of Homebrew spells, Make use of the Magic Game for Arcana checks
Explore underutilised factions in the world,

Mode of delivery: 
	Character creation rule:
		* Must know of and have encountered Kholirahi, Furi, or Cult Agents, in a major capacity in their backstory. 
		* Characters start at level 5 (be prepared for 6 after session 1) and will end after 20
			* All offical works and select approved homebrews are allowed. Except centaurs
				* Extreme modification of some of these are also allowed
			* There is no limit to the amount of munchkin bullshit I am willing to endure, provided it makes sense in the world. If you build the power nine and can summon gods with it? Good. 
				* No simulacrum, still
			* Multiclass prereqs do not exist.
				* talk to me about stat-swapping any facet of a class, race, feature, spell, etc;
			* Free Starting Feat or other advantage starting
			* Point buy/standard array
			* Characters using any of the homebrew options that are specific to snarl get an extra uncommon magic item on creation
			* come with one ambition; Kill the godking, make a country 


	Campaign bargain
		* This is not a grindy campaign but it has rewards for those that look for them, rather ridiculous rewards
		* The more holes you fill, the more your characters will be written into the history of this world.
		* Levelling will come much faster than previous campaigns
	Campaign concept
		* I need a lot of people to die. And I need a lot of badasses to do it.



Considerations
	Levels needed:
		15
		
		6 vignette
		7  Enfuckerator quest
			The party gets a delivery quest to drop off an unstable arcanohedron, a device of strange mystic capabilities. Thugs will rather incessantly try to steal it, as it is a construction of immense power, capable of being used in 12th level magic in a rather general way. 
				* Furi thugs obviously want it for cash
				* The Cult wants it to break another bone artifact
				* Kholira wants it to allow the godking to ascend as a true deity-class entitty
				* Starspawn seem attracted to it as the moon is trying  Kill everything on this plane
			* The Recipient is Nirrum the Mad, or what's left of him
			* The party is first accosted by moon-touched and Kholirahi
		8 Feywild/Maze
			* The party must have reasonable amounts of treasure
		9  End
			* Party gets a house somehow 540 sqft, thus 54g in tax per year +7/person
			* Party is informed that several people have been arrested trying to hunt them down.
		10  Feywild/Maze
		11 End
			* You are met by yourself on your way out of and into your door
			* You also find yourself getting stabbed in an alleyway, You are surprised that this is from a third person perspective. The third person is you, you are watching yourself get stabbed
			* The police have put three of the same person to death, imprisoned six others. They've employed someone with truesight to see if you're real, and the person is amazed at how well the illusion you have is holding up and that they can't see through it. They are shocked to be reminded that being actual people is a possibility

The song:
	Perhaps the opening, Piano and harps, a journey to blackwater at some point

	Lone cello of sublime power, the snare of of boots, Resonant carnyx call of conflict.
	Lap steel guitar of threat, power not yet tapped. 
	These people are not powerless. Discongruity lie within how I percieve want.
	Dear sister has given me the answer: the voice, screaming chanting, singing, crying: Find their flaws
	
	the verse of Greed sings the choir
		a singlet viol drones of the great staff of the godking
		the locust rubbing of a bowed quartet of the heist required to raid Dwallat
		glass armonica accompanied by glockenspiel, the glimmer in the depths
