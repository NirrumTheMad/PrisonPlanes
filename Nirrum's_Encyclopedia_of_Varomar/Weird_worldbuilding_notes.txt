**Giants and Clicking and infrasound**
Giants in this world use click consonants in communication not unlike those found in many African languages, like !xhosa. This was originally just an aesthetic choice, I wanted the giants to be clearly mostly human but different from the average audience, and on top of that I wanted to empower whatever audience I was othering by making sure there was no real allegory tied to the cultures that used click consonants.  I wanted to include them somewhere. Combining these two ideas gave the giants, this intrinsically powerful race with its own unique cultures and attitudes, a different style of voice than just human 2, which in our context often just becomes a bland tweak of the western european narrative. Or at least it seems to. Including diverse elements might not promote accurate understanding of the cultures they came from but it at least tells someone that those elements are there and can be //understood. // As a result though, I also have to give giants a much better infrasound hearing range. Their mouths and throats are bigger, they're going to have deeper clicks and deeper voices. Incidentally, this means that their voices can travel farther and lends much more power to the narrative of the ordning. Low pitches have better times resisting attenuation than higher pitches, and in particular for the storm giants,  who spend much of their time underwater and far apart from eachother, this lends to their cultural narrative much much more than people expect. See, they're not really that spread out and distant from eachother in //their// eyes. They're at a respectable and reasonable range from which they can commnicate effectively if they need to while not being disruptive. They're probably not too different from humans proportionately on average. 

**Unicorns and Evil**
As axiomatically and artificially as centaurs being eaten by the sun, Unicorns in this world are (nearly) //always //evil. The logic (the highly disingenous logic) goes something like this. You have a creature that is capable of teleporting up to a mile and is usually the exceptional paragon of goodness and sparkles and other weird things. You have a plane which is host almost exclusively to creatures who got caught in failures of interplanar magic and the descendants thereof. How do those two combine? Anyone who is powerful enough to banish a unicorn and is good probably wouldn't want to. Anyone who is Powerful enough and is evil has less than no reason to, if they're evil, they'll just kill the unicorn and take its valuable alchemical parts, either for money or for their own uses. So who banishes unicorns and why? The answer is going to mostly be creatures who don't have the heart (or would be cursed by) the killing of  a unicorn. Good creatures. And the only unicorns they're going to ever want to just //banish?// Evil ones.  Selection processes like this are very important to Snarl and the prison planes setting, in particular because we're bards and everything must be finely crafted. That doesn't make it any less bullshit though. This is just a tongue-in-cheek way of stirring up the world so that it's not exactly what players expect. In my context, where people are used to worlds where their contexts are a bit more...whimsical... and less concerned with the broader effects of actions, this tends to come as a surprise, especially when there's a (what sounds like) valid reason for it.

**Steve**
Steve's the best guy and you lay the fuck off OK? Steve is a unicorn currently living in the realms of the trinity gulf, mostly just doing his own thing along with one other unicorn. Now. Importantly, when steve first came up, in was in a quest on Jianok Sio with the red mist pirate crew. They killed all the unicorns and captured four. One left with Usagi, the moon cleric, another left with Xundrin,  Two stayed with Tibeaux. One was evil and one was steve. We were playing on a battlemat at the time and I ran out of horse tokens and lego horses to represent the unicorns.... so I used the white bear lego piece we have. "It's a unicorn guys, shut up, his name is steve and he's the best". Well, Steve stuck around and got even better years later when I went looking for a picture of a unicorn bear and found Bjarndýrakóngur, A (purportedly) Icelandic Myth, sometimes calling this creature the king of the bears. A massive bear with, huh, a unicorn horn. One of the great lessons in worldbuilding is that syncretism and retrospect are tools that you can use to make people think you knew what you were doing the entire time. So now the king of the bears idles quietly in the far southern island of grand tortuga, lazily eating fish and generally just being the best.

**Halflings, Drow, Tieflings, and a new home**
In snarl, you'll find some peculiarities among the races. There are a heavy mix of old-hat tropes and strange new ideas in among cultures. The three most notable of these are the Halflings, the Drow, and the Tieflings. In general you can always tell who is native to snarl and who is not just by looking at them. The drow from other worlds are edgy, driven by lolth to do evil acts against their people, the culture held intact by one controlling narcissist of a god, who occasionally lets it fly apart. The Drow here are quiet, a bit spooky, and pretty independant but they're by no means evil. Very few of the drow seem to //care// anymore about other races, let alone their own. For their convenience many of them //do// live in cities, the major ones being Cermina and Skalmirthon, but many just live in isolated clusters in the underark. The halflings from other planes tend to be happy-go-lucky western european analogues with a love for food and mischief and somehow haven't had their community collapse under single power-hungry individuals. On Snarl, the halflings maintain their sense of community and their luck, but they are a much hardier and rough race, they are nomadic and far more willing to commit acts of violence, with a deeper respect for other people's property, if not their space. And Tieflings? Offworld tieflings are perpetually dour. Native tieflings all seem to have their own resting smile. While this facet isn't quite genetic, it //essentially //is hereditary. There are two reasons for all of these. In lore, the Drow are disconnected from lolth, she has only minor influence over them and has no desire to really partake in this world (though a player character, cleric of lolth might be the turning point). Yondalla, for the halflings offers her blessing of luck, but luck is stretched thin in this world, She is not as powerful as she wants to be for her people here. And the tieflings? It's a product of their infernal heritage, and a reference to the freedom that they experience on this plane, where the infernal entities are almost always just different types of prisoners including asmodeus humself. Out of lore, the drow culture is intrinsically matriarchical, and having the only matriarchy be //evil// doesn't have good echoes on it. It's not that it's not plausible, it's that by challenging it at all, it challenges people realize they wouldn't have questioned it otherwise. Whatever your answer, you at least have one now. This opened up the drow to the more distant theme that I use for elves on this plane. They're all effectively immortal and their grasp of consequence is hampered by their reincarnation, for once, perhaps to correlon's delight, the elves are all forced to be a bit different. In this case I used the drow to highlight how some cultures may have lasting elements from their original context, even when the greater context is removed. I did the opposite with the Halflings and let them keep their greater context, the favour of their god, but took away their culture and made them adapt. I left pebblerpony as the place where the new halflings usually end up going, a sort of shire analogue. As for tieflings, in the fourth edition character builder, from all of the tiefling art, there were four emotions: Dour, Angry, Impassive, and afraid. On occasion there was sadness. The tieflings were so ludicrously grim *except* for the last picture. Modai vell, apparently, had this big jolly smile on with this big glitter in his eye. That Image became Deloch welch, and the clothing was the reason for Manaharamu being placed in the desert. As the campaigns went on, with the exception of //one// person from the first three or so sessions, //every single tiefling was depicted smiling in their art. //**This was entirely by coincidence.** As mentioned before, retrospect and syncretism is no reason to not make it look like you knew what you were doing all along



**Interesting Martial traditions**
in creating my world, I had to address the realities of people having  conflict among eachother over millenia, here is a brief list and basic description of some relevant martial traditions that would have had to exist. Some of them are noted  in magic items and among lore bits. These might be moved into their respective areas later.
	* **Konia's Silver Knights: **As a largely nonmagical people  in snarl, the Konians reliad heavily on their melee martial tradition and their superior tactics. While they didn't compare to the dwarves in smithing quality, their armor technology was ultimately more suited for their context, beng lighter to wear, especially on a horse, more form fitting, and better at dispersing energy, though overall being fairly equally protective. Konian silver knights made incredible use of heavy cavalry charges and where where you would find the largest concentration of cavaliers and battlemaster fighters. The konian's ancestral enemy, the Manaharahi are //extremely// magically focused and in order to deal with this, the silver knights developed some powerful counters. Their short Yataghans, which they would always have on them increased all of their defenses and they had a potent enchantment on their bows for dispelling magic where their arrows landed, which was devastating against the manaharahi. In hand to hand combat, the silver knights preferred grappling. Silver knights were quite comfortable in their armor and were able to swim in it, though this was mostly done for sport with weights instead of expensive armour. The knights were at their best in close quarters, where they were able to make particular use of their martial arts. Konian Silver knights work excellently on their own and the group tactics are rather spread out, partially out of necessity from fighting magical enemies.
	* **Konia's Ghostwardens: **After the war of ants, the Archers from the walls of Konia were the most untouched. The undead that rose from the assault of Manaharamu were left to wander across Konia's fields and orchards as people succumbed to bitter emotions before death. To get food from the rich land, the archers developed techniques for avoiding being seen by the undead, as well as counters to many curses. Their techniques were passed on and developed into a fresh martial tradtion not unlike the Ramishi's use of outriders and skirmishers, though with a greater focus on getting food.
	* **Graoton's goatriders: **The Graotan Goat riders were, as the name suggests, mostly mounted on large war goats, suitable for fighting on the cliffs and in the stony fields of groatan. Their martial tradition was centered around Eldritch knights, mostly arcane ones. Specialized knights weilding magic other than wizardly magic were uncommon but they did exist. The goatriders used polearms designed for controlling the battlefield, either holding a line with their halberds, lifting enemies off their feet with their jumonjiyari tridents,  or pulling them off of  of their mounts with lochabers. In tandem with other Goatriders, the Graotan knights were frighteningly effective, One pulling an opponent off a mount, another lifting them away from their formation. Often others would follow up with offensive spells before riding in themselves. These soldiers were always more effective in a group than they were on their own, but in said groups, they outshone most other martial traditions
	* **Shaat Daar** **Iron Wings: **The hobgoblins of the south coast have always kept in touch with their ancestral arts. Their smithing techniques focusing on supple tempering and high-flexibility metals. Their style of weaponsmithing currently most resembles the Japanese, interestingly so does their architecture, armour and food and for this reason, their equipment is described similarly. It is worth noting that the reasons for this similarity is because of the similarity in context. The main differences are that the iron is extracted from costal sand with magnet-trawling skiffs and that there is plenty for armour. The hobgoblins do not like giving up ground and are tactically resilient, being outmatched only by the dwarves in their ability to hold a position. Their martial arts reflect this. Their Nagamaki are especially good at killing mounts and large monsters, including dragons and various sea creatures. They are fearsome for their use of Nodachi, greatswords, while on their shallow-bottom boats in the Mananan gulf (etymologically unrelate to Manar). Much like the seven spears of Danzuishan, they use battlemaster tactics to position around enemies maintaining fluidity in their squads to defeat their enemies. They are fearsome strikers in close combat and it is not uncommon to find them with some levels in monk. The Iron wings in particular are known for being stable and mobile on foot and excellent strikers but still intimidating with their large weapons. 
	* **Dansuishanese Ninjas: **to understand the Danzuishanese Ninjas, you must understand the two aspects of the civil war, aside from the hit and run tactics, much of the civil war was not built on obvious lines and spying was rife. Ninjas were and still are mostly spies, but in this context, they had to learn how to conceal their weapons when being approached. Many of the techniques that are utterly ahistorical on //earth// are widly used on snarl.  The Danzuishanese ninja are //exceptionally// tricky, making use of wide multiclasssing and techniques from all over  the world.  They focus on escape, being unseen or unnoticed and killing warlocks specifically. Warlocks often have the ability to see through their illusions, which is very annoying. They make for excellent strikers and wil often take the six levels in way of shadow monk, though other levels and classes are not uncommon
	* **Danzuishanese Maze Hunter:** There is no set of training on snarl that can quite match the depth of understanding undertaken by traditional Maze Hunters. There is no context to prepare for within the maze, there are no guarantees within the maze, because of this, the Maze hunters train eachother in particularly versatile and safe forms of combat. They lack mounts and often make use of symmetrical longswords with thick cross sections, hammer-like crossguard ends, each sized specifically to the hunter's sternum, being judged as the optimal mechanical ratio for several techniques. These longswords are well suited to being thrown, and their blunt ricasso allows for a slightly more secure handhold when using the tip or the crossguard in halfswording. Maze hunters are not spectacular with unarmed combat, but use their weapons to grapple in a similar ways. Other common weapons for maze hunters are Tabars and rope darts, both being spectacularly useful. Picks and hooks for climbing are also frequently useful, but a maze hunter needs to be careful that their equipment doesn't attract rather common things like lightning or cause them to drown. Even if the maze isn't predictable, it's not completely bonkers, and that's enough to have a strategy.
	* **Danzuishanese Razers: **Razing an encampment is hard work. When the Danzuishanese civil war was raging, an effective strategy was to make an area useless to enemies was to rush in, form a line, throw everything behind the line into a pile and then hit it with a breath weapon. The danzuishanese  martial tradition is extremely widely varied but heavily curved swords, similar to shamshirs and tulwars are useful in the dense jungle of the lower gannaga, Used often in combination with separs or Dahls, small round shields. While this strategy isn't particularly effective against cavalry, cavalry is ill-suited to the jungle terrain. On top of this, the strategy is exceptionally well suited to naval battles. This, along with the breath weapons of the Danzuishanese, as well as their later occupation by dragons, is the biggest factor in why Danzuishan has never lost an external invasion...except by the dragons, but they don't count that
	* **Turtle Pirates: **Grand tortuga is a harsh place. One often gets conscripted into a faction quickly. Despite this rapid division, the way turtle rogues tend to fight is pretty standardized across the respective navies. Turtle pirates are aggressive, teleporting multiple pirates onto a single target and eliminating them quickly, then teleporting or running to the next target. They have no problems grappling but are not fantastic strikers in unarmed combat. 
	* **Lelumadil Soldiers: **Ever the practical people, the dwarves of lelumadil specialize in repelling sieges and fighting in tunnels. Much like the stereotype would suggest, they use drastically overbuilt armour. Because of the presence of the underground sea, most armour has built in flotation aids. That said, despite stereotypes, the dwarves of Skalmirthon rarely use  axes, reserving them for special people. The lelumadil tradition favours harpoons, thrusting into enemies and enemy formations and then hauling them through dense shield walls. The dwarves //always // work as a unit, and their martial arts are focused on pulling people in to their formation and swarming them, sort of the opposite of the Graotanese strategy. This of course does have an exception. In lelumadil lore, their ancestral Mersethdatan was defended by two brother warriors, an elf and a human, both of whom used axes to repel a goblin invasion, though foreigners, these two laid down their life for mersethdatan, taking out over seventy trolls and goblins apiece. For dwarves that have performed exceptional services to mersethdatan, they are given the opportunity to master a weapon of their choice and fancy, which, owing to the legends of the brother warriors tends to be axes. short and specialized picks tend to be the most used weapon next to the harpoon, being held backhanded and close to the body. The dwarves use the turning of the body and a punching like motion while holding the pick in two hands to get as much leverage as they can while taking up  as little room as possible for fighting in tight tunnels.
