====== The Xanarankehi ======
Created Sunday 24 September 2023

Xanaran's bar and inn is a mark of civilization, a fixture of life for people across many planes of existence. Headed by Barstomun Ironthroat, with a lengthy list of rules that every Xanaran's follows. Named after a certainly long dead or at least absent Red Dragonborn, from a plane far away, the Xanarankehi is certainly NOT the original ideator of Xanaran's bar and inn. It is merely obsessed with it. To the Xanarankehi, a Xanaran's is something perfect, something they can understand when everything else is so perfectly strange. Barstomun appears to be the key. The Xanarankehi understands barstomun and Barstomun understands how to run a Xanaran's in any context, or at least how to try. The Xanarankehi is so focused on this single facet of understandable reality that it serves as a protector against threats that it is literally impossible to imagine, simply because whenever something destroys one Xanaran's too many, on any level, the Xanarankehi Lashes out with immense abhorrence. Nothing can communicate with it, nothing seems to be able to overpower it.
