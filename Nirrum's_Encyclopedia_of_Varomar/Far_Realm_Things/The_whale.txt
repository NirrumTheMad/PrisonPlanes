====== The whale ======
Created Saturday 23 September 2023

In the great infinities of the far realm, few things are self-aware. Thankfully, Joe, the whale, is. Joe is an explorer, a plumber of deep mysteries, and only occasionally a semi-apocalyptic disaster. On rare occasions, Joe enters snarl, completely ignoring its containment field, Shrugging off both the Sun and the Warden of Lightning, and offering people a chance to finish their business and follow him. 

The whale is a great old one patron. He is easy to contact and his wants in exchange for power are usually fairly simple. The Whale wants information on places to go from his intelligent contractors and more minds to follow him from his more charismatic ones. This fulfills the conditions of the pact, from which, the whale will grant knowledge befitting of a warlock.
