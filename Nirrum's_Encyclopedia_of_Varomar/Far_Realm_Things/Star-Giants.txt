====== Star-Giants ======
Created Friday 17 November 2023

Star giants are often seen as gods on the planets they land on. Capable of great magical foresight, these beings leap from planet to planet, sphere to sphere, star to star, Entirely unconcerned with the destruction they cause when they land or leave. Frequently they nap in the hearts of stars (dangerous in this neighbourhood, as a few local stars are rather hungry), or rest for centuries on planets. Interestingly they still speak giant, but there is next to nothing a creature capable of less than 10th level magic can even do to or for such a being.
