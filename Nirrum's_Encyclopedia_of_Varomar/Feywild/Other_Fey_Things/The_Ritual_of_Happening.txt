====== The Ritual of Happening ======
Created Monday 22 August 2022

It is rare that the fey get along with those outside their court. The Mechanisms of their views of the world are too differerent to often align, but when they do, their machinations increase in potency.

When a group of fey from each court get a single idea in their head, their very presence together begins the rare **ritual of happening.** The Power of this ritual is poorly understood, save that it outstrips the wish spell in its ability to rewrite reality. 
//Set by the court of Terror//
//Arranged by the Court of Whispers//
//Tuned by the court of swords//
//Chosen by  the court of Glamour//
//Shaped by the court of lore,//
//Performed by the court of valour//

Each thing that a fey contributes to a happening builds in power, rather naturally, quite like a mortal project to build a hydroelectric dam, but with less dependance on frivolities like "the conservation of mass" and "entropy". 


It usually starts with the court of lore's efforts to describe something in the material world.
From there, the court of Terror almost always chooses a person who they know enough about and wish to prey on. They begin to set up mechanisms for the person to fall into.
The court of Valour invariably finds these mechanisms and should they choose, they can string them together, so now this person has a beginning and an end to their story.
The court of Terror finds the story and builds the world around it, making the lands more suitable to the things that will be felt there.
Of course, the court of swords sees those powerful moments in the middle and in those moments will move the hands of fate themselves to feel it,
The court of glamour Furnishes all of these things with stunning sensations.

While it may seem simple, there is a recursive nature to this, and the order isn't necessarily this. Any of the other courts may start the ritual and rarely are many of the fey aware of what is occuring. As each fey makes a change, bits of their magic are poured into the events, until there is complex magic of immense capacity following the path of a single person
