====== The Ritual of Happening ======
Created Monday 22 August 2022

It is rare that the fey get along with those outside their court. The Mechanisms of their views of the world are too differerent to often align, but when they do, their machinations increase in potency.

When a group of fey from each court get a single idea in their head, their very presence together begins the rare **ritual of happening.** The Power of this ritual is poorly understood, save that it outstrips the wish spell in its ability to rewrite reality. 
//Set by the court of Terror//
//Arranged by the Court of Whispers//
//Tuned by the court of swords//
//Chosen by  the court of Glamour//
//Shaped by the court of lore,//
//Performed by the court of valour//

Each thing that a fey contributes to a happening builds in power, rather naturally, quite like a mortal project to build a hydroelectric dam, but with less dependance on frivolities like "the conservation of mass" and "entropy".
