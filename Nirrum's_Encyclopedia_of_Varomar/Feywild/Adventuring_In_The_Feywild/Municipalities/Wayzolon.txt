====== Wayzolon ======
Created Tuesday 01 March 2022

Wayzolon is a town in the evening regions and favoured of whispers fey. Tucked in a Gamnus Oak, the light of Wayzolon often brings travellers in as they wander the branchland. Houses here are carved into the thick limbs and trunk of the Oak. While there is a mayor in Wayzolon, it is hard to discern who it is, perhaps even by the mayor themself, as this town is filled with whispers fey. Thankfully, there is a respite of Sanity, as within the main trunk is a Xanaran's. Truthfully, the whole town might as well be in the Xanarans, as the normal minty green wallpaper is riddled with small doors that lead into small homes.  The Barstomun Strongbeard in this place is dressed with glittery navy eyeshadow, a black suit and tie, and has wrought iron wings on hinges poking through the suit jacket. His pants and boots are the same ones he usually wears.

		**Courtly buildings and folk.**
		Loreshop: A place to buy and sell items
			Sitting among a particularly dense tangle of branches one will find a hill giant called "the Scomblur," who swears he is a fey, and everyone seems to agree with him. He sells all sorts of items that are hung up on the branches around him.
		Glamouresque: A place to change aesthetics
			built into one of the limbs that serve as a road is a door leading to a large tubular room is an eladrin called "The munea", and while they have a name they can share freely, they choose not to.
		Valourboard:
			Inside a large round door is a fey hobgoblin home, the inhabitants noteworthy for their purple hair. At the back of the open concept room, adorned with cushions and mosaics of great tales, is a rather imposing old woman, her purple hair streaked with white. She Holds a long, rounded bar mace, and when approached she pulls out a large board that is marked in both goblin and sylvan with a series of quests. "HAVE YOU ACCOMPLISHED ANY OF THESE DEEDS? IF YOU HAVE I SHALL PAY YOU FOR THEIR STORIES" she will say as she smacks the board with the bar mace
		Whispermonger:
			In a hollow between branches, one can find a ladder leading up in not quite the direction one came from. at the top is a short, cylindrical tube that runs horizontally within a branch. At the end, a corridor that takes four left turns brings you to the dwelling of The Therababalikaia, Archfey of Intrusive thoughts. The Therababalikaia is a green and white grub with four short arms that end in four-fingered hands with an extra joint each. They are excellent at gaslighting. 
				**The Therababalikaia, **Archfey of Intrusive thoughts (INTJ)
					A sickly worm that wants to be seen as cool
						Height: 5'4
						Influence: Insight(Charisma) 17 to break through his enchantment. Otherwise he will appear similar to Thorcurin, of the court of Glamour
						Favour: 1440
					Tucked away where it is easy to save on magic, the Therababalikaia recognizes that they look unfortunate, though they lack any of the grace of The Shymbalaeo to compensate, despite their phenomenal sounding name. The Therababalikaia will grant favour to those who complete quests for them, as well as those who can procure a horditordi pear for them. They return favour in the form of a special chemical bomb. This bomb, a Shouael sphere, works much like a smoke grenade, though instead of releasing smoke, it releases distracting thoughts into the minds of the people who are caught in the blast. The Therababalikaia takes requests on what those thoughts are.
