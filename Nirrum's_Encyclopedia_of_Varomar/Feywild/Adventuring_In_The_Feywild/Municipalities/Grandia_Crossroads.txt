====== Grandia Crossroads ======
Created Wednesday 09 March 2022

Many paths in the noon lead toward Grandia, it is a bustling hub, made of impossibly high spires (and matchingly difficult staircases).  Built on a sprawling bladefen in a bowl between cloudscraping Highmeads, Grandia is one of the greatest cities in the feywild. It has to be. An Elf who came through this bladefen when it was young Challenged the swords fey to a "not building a successful civilization contest," not knowing of the magic that forces the sword fey to always  lose, and only wanting to use the land to build. It was after this that the high courts decreed that all bladefen challenges must be "in the time of a duel", as the Grandia Crossroads incident is a still ongoing challenge. The Aster bulbs have grown to enormous sizes, Ringing the city between the roads with swollen calyxes the size of elephants, The weapons they grew around entirely covered by the impossibly dense foliage, twisted and gnarled by the perversion of magic 



==== Urban: ====
	Grandia is colloquially subdivided into Fifteen conceptual regions, ostensibly there's more but no one can find them. Each region, called a burrow, is host to a unique subculture within the fey. Blends of courtly politics and reasonable social interaction are common, and this is where many of the trans-court fey can be found. 
		//nirrum's note: It is rare to say the least that any member of the fey changes court. It's not so much a decision as a consequence of the world changing. Each fey knows who they are and where they belong, but the world is complex and prone to being difficult, so on occasion, someone who was already on the border of some other court's sphere will find themselves entirely within their influence, and will adjust their practices accordingly. //

=== Millinininia row ===
	Millinininia row curls its way around the highland sides of the city, in a place where it still gets some sunlight but is frequently overshadowed by everything that could be considered tall within the city. Here one can expect to find fey and fey services more catered to some mix between swords and valour. Here, fey focused on elements of rising action, increasing tension, parts of their works that are most necessary for the whole. Several would-be courtly heads abide here, torn between the magic of the whole and the magic of the part.
