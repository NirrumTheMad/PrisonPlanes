====== Shildeerintin ======
Created Saturday 19 February 2022 

Shildeerintin is a village on the sunset, near a wide, white ticking forest of Cottonfirs and Thistlepine (entirely unrelated species). The houses here are commonly A-frames with Doors set into the roof. Near the edge of town, houses are large, and quite suited for Giants and Giant Kin. As one progresses in toward the town center, the houses get smaller and smaller. The Town has two Xanaran's, despite its rather small popualtion, only a couple thousand. One of the Xanarans' is very small, suited to serving pixies and sprites, and instead of being run by Barstomun strongbeard, there is a green sprite with a vibrant pink beard named The squimees who runs it instead. Barstomun himself is present and runs a normal sized one in the middle of town. 
	Locations
		**Courtly buildings and folk. **In the Feywild
			Loreshop: A place to buy and sell items
				This building appears quite large, despite being in the middle ring of town, its green painted shingles and large oaken door bear the mark of the court of Lore. The Door handle is a crank that operates a hidden planetary gear, with the action circling the mark on the door. As one turns the handle, whirring and clicking can be heard until a loud clunk signals the door is unlatched. The smell of fragrant bay leaves and cedar  whispers out of the foyer. Undoubtedly excited to see all of the wares, an expectant traveler will be invariably surprised at how quickly they can browse the entire store, as it is, rather substantially, Smaller on the inside. The Cramped room can hold, at most, Three medium and one small creature at once, and that small creature is the Gnome  named Musonkhin Giddylids. Musonkhin is surprised and a little exasperated at people taking up so much room in his shop, though he is keen to do business. He will buy all sorts of items (Particularly ones that people have difficulty selling) and will pay in either gold or Favour, both are redeemable in the shop. If asked about the size of the shop, he tiredly says "This is what you get for cheap favour, Gnome or not"
			Glamouresque: A place to change aesthetics
				The Shingles of this building are starkly faceted amber, which reveals the movement of the people inside it, and shines brightly in the sunlight. It sits on the edge of town and inside sits a rather handsome red-haired giant with stripes of red and black on an otherwise pale face, Or perhaps stripes of white and red on a black face, or possibly black and white on a red face. He is a Fomorian, though he is an uncursed one, and keen to keep it that way. He is called "The woodherald", and offers a simple exchange to all who come to him. For a favour worth at least 490 or more, He can change the appearance of any object to any creature without truesight. The object functions exactly as it did originally, and must be somewhat similar or a different magic must be used, disguising a sword as a mug is possible but costs ten times more. 
			Valourboard: a place for quests!
				A Solid slab of spruigia is tactfully spiked to the walls of both Xanaran's. On it are bits of paper, vellum, and bark, each rewarding one favour.
			Whispermonger: Also a place for quests!
				Hidden in a puddle, often with a short line leading up to it, is a pale-faced, wide-mouthed and grinning goblin-like creature's face sits instead of a reflection. The creature offers random jobs in exchange for two favours, one good, one weak. Whispermongers are often used by less powerful fey as a sort of payday loan, a way  for them to get things accomplished when they can't do it on their own. It is invariably predatory
			Terrorspeaker: A forewarning of the circumstances of journeys leading from the town in the near future. Omens
				Covered in a thick brown blanket against a very out-of-place oak tree is a wizened and wrinkled human-like old man. When approached, his centipede-like body frailly rises from the blanket and levels his face with any and for a favour of any quality will give an omen, telling the party what weather they will face on a weak favour, but for a strong favour, the terrorspeaker will give a plot hint in threatening language as well as the weather and notable other conditions that may change in the feywild
			Swordguides: Travel Guides!
				In Any fey town, a swordguide is available. Swordguides are capable of Guiding non-fey folk to any structure, for a favour per region. If the favour is large enough, a more powerful fey is called to escort people instead. The next nearest town is Runewood, a six day journey.
			Mayor's House
				The mayor of this town is an //exceptionally tiny// creature that looks like a Green Kidney bean with arms and legs that wears a stylish renaissance hat with a yellow plume that is almost as large as she is. She wears a tiny vest and pants made of silk. As she is the mayor, she lives at the centre of town, and as such, her house is the tiniest. She has no capability to be mayor, but she must be the mayor as she lives in the centermost house in town
