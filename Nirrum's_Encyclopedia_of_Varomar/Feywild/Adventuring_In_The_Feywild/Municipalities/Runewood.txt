====== Runewood ======
Created Saturday 06 November 2021 

==== **Runewood** ====
	Sitting somewhere in the cool midmorning is one of the few settlements of prime material folk in the feywild. This is home to the Aulufeydth orcs and the green knights. Runewood isn't large enough to be a city, a few thousand residents under the guidance of **The Worlitraw, Archfey of Contact Surfaces. ** Houses here vary wildly in size, from grand mansions to small huts, often next to eachother. Each house is limited to the height of a tree nearby, and is allowed to be no taller. As a result, the largest houses are not only the oldest but built near Spruigia. Different families will maintain different types of tree, from all over the feywild. To cut down a tree tied to a house in this place means death to the person who did it and pretty much everyone associated with them.

	**The Worlitraw, Archfey of contact surfaces (ESFP) (**Fighter Cavalier 11) 
		This noble and honorable fey is entirely encased in a bumpy suit of black armour that completely obscures them
			Hieght: 3'11
			Influence: Acrobatics (strength) 18 to spin 5 times in one push
			Favour: 1210
	The Worlitraw speaks in a high pitched (bad high british) voice and is enamoured with acts of valour, despite being a fey of lore. He wields a lance and always counts as mounted as his heels have two metal wheels on each side of his pointy and curled toed sabatons, which autonomously rotate to drive him forward. The Worlitraw offers favour to those who bring technology made with bushings, bearings, hinges, cogs, and any non-fixed contact surface that has been made with a check of 22 or higher. For Favour, the Worlitraw will  gift a person 30 tiny applications of// The ultimate lubricant//  which is made of **hypocritical helium**, which is supercritical helium, just magically at room temperature and with a higher surface tension. It has the marvellous property of making any surface nearly frictionless for hundreds of years. Alternately, he will alter one melee weapon within the person's posession to have a +4 to attack and damage rolls, replacing any other bonus, but not other magical effects. Finally, He can grant the Kn√∏rra rune to anyone who knows the magic of runes. 

	Runewood produces foot in the form of fruit and the flesh of fey beasts. The Orclings of Aulufeydth are raised nearly entirely on magical food. Aulufeydth have names for the stages that children go through as they age, as each one is tied to what food is safe for them to eat. 
		**Nama - **Nursing or weening infants
		**Goolin - **Infants capable of eating solid food, they are only allowed food such as goodberry or Spideryam
		**Krandle - **Fully autonomous prepubescent youth. These ones are allowed to eat skyfish meats, and it is the first meat they will have tasted.
		**Zoozin - **Pubescent youth. As with many races, there's not much that can stop people in this stage of life from being impulsive. They are now allowed to try all things that the Aulufeydth can provide, but are warned of what ones may lead to their death. 
		**Umwaa - **Fully grown adults, most of which have become fully accusomted to eating things in the feywild and no longer panic when they occasionally turn into a bird for a while
	Waste disposal has never been an issue in Runewood, and no one knows why. Waste gets thrown onto the nearest spruigia tree and even the most diligent explorers have never been able to figure out where it goes.
