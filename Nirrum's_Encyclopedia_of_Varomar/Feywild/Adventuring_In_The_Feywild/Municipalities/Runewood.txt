====== Runewood ======
Created Saturday 06 November 2021 

==== **Runewood** ====
	Sitting somewhere in the cool midmorning is one of the few settlements of prime material folk in the feywild. This is home to the Aulufeydth orcs and the green knights. Runewood isn't large enough to be a city, a few thousand residents under the guidance of **The Worlitraw, Archfey of Contact Surfaces. ** Houses here vary wildly in size, from grand mansions to small huts, often next to eachother. Each house is limited to the height of a tree nearby, and is allowed to be no taller. As a result, the largest houses are not only the oldest but built near Spruigia. Different families will maintain different types of tree, from all over the feywild. To cut down a tree tied to a house in this place means death to the person who did it and pretty much everyone associated with them.

	**The Worlitraw, Archfey of contact surfaces (ESFP) (**Fighter Cavalier 11) 
		This noble and honorable fey is entirely encased in a bumpy suit of black armour that completely obscures them
			Hieght: 3'11
			Influence: Acrobatics (strength) 18 to spin 5 times in one push
			Favour: 1210
	The Worlitraw speaks in a high pitched (bad high british) voice and is enamoured with acts of valour, despite being a fey of lore. He wields a lance and always counts as mounted as his heels have two metal wheels on each side of his pointy and curled toed sabatons, which autonomously rotate to drive him forward. The Worlitraw offers favour to those who bring technology made with bushings, bearings, hinges, cogs, and any non-fixed contact surface that has been made with a check of 22 or higher. For Favour, the Worlitraw will  gift a person 30 tiny applications of// The ultimate lubricant//  which is made of **hypocritical helium**, which is supercritical helium, just magically at room temperature and with a higher surface tension. It has the marvellous property of making any surface nearly frictionless for hundreds of years. Alternately, he will alter one melee weapon within the person's posession to have a +4 to attack and damage rolls, replacing any other bonus, but not other magical effects. Finally, He can grant the Kn√∏rra rune to anyone who knows the magic of runes. 

	Runewood produces food in the form of fruit and the flesh of fey beasts. The Orclings of Aulufeydth are raised nearly entirely on magical food. Aulufeydth have names for the stages that children go through as they age, as each one is tied to what food is safe for them to eat. 
		**Nama - **Nursing or weening infants
		**Goolin - **Infants capable of eating solid food, they are only allowed food such as goodberry or Spideryam
		**Krandle - **Fully autonomous prepubescent youth. These ones are allowed to eat skyfish meats, and it is the first meat they will have tasted.
		**Zoozin - **Pubescent youth. As with many races, there's not much that can stop people in this stage of life from being impulsive. They are now allowed to try all things that the Aulufeydth can provide, but are warned of what ones may lead to their death. 
		**Umwaa - **Fully grown adults, most of which have become fully accusomted to eating things in the feywild and no longer panic when they occasionally turn into a bird for a while
	Waste disposal has never been an issue in Runewood, and no one knows why. Waste gets thrown onto the nearest spruigia tree and even the most diligent explorers have never been able to figure out where it goes. 
	

=== Sights ===
	**Housegarden. **Some people in runewood are not happy with their lot, and as a result have built a nursery for trees they intend to use as the basis for their family's home, long after they have died. It serves as a park where people can rest, but camping is very very illegal.
	
	**Eynga Waterfall. **Just below the spring that serves as their water source, a two hundred foot high waterfall that plunges to the bottom of the spruigia. Creatures that jump off the waterfall still take 10d6 bludgeoning damage from falling unless they make the DC5 acrobatics check to land close to where the waterfall itself enters the water. The pool at the bottom is extremely deep and no one has ever actually reached the bottom. This is a very popular swimming hole, though there are others around
	
	**Kruilo The Wide. **A wide and flat juniper tree that covers a very large field. The branches are sparse, and this is one of the few places in runewood where you can consistently see the sky.  This is where the order of Green knights train. Aulufeydth Zoozin tend to outnumber the more experienced warriors as all youth want to try to be a green knight, though few can really hack it. 
	

=== Shops ===
	**Ginbar's Smithy. **Ginbar is the most eminent smith of the Aulufeydth. He needs no forge, just a hammer, anvil, and slack tub. Metal heats on its own in Ginbar's hands, a talent that he says he got when he went to the spiral academy near the dawnpoint. Because of his talent, Ginbar is capable of resizing armor in a quarter of the time and for a quarter of the cost. 
	
	**Au loom. **The looms of the Aulufeydth produce practical threads for their people. Summer clothes that are light and airy, quick to wick moisture and to dry, tough and difficult to tear or fray. The fabric is most often silk, though tree cotton isn't unheard of. The Aulufeydth enjoy natural colours, beige, brown, black, white, whatever the fibre is by default, though each piece of clothing always has at least one element that is dyed some bright colour.
	
	**Mugguo's Balconies. **Mugguo  inherited a massively tall spruigia estate with nothing on it, no talent, and very little money to start. Mugguo stepped into the dangerous realm of courtly politics, and between translation work between the courts of swords and valour, as well as consults for the court of Glamour, they managed to scrape together enough favour for a plan. They built a restaurant out of a single tall central staircase, opening to tens of balconies. Workers bring food and drink up and down to each floor with external elevators, while guests use the central stairway. A small toilet is hidden just out of view on each floor, running into a single clay pipe out to the base of the tree, where it disappears. One of the most famous dishes here is Jammed Forzeta, very similar in flavour to moose, though chewier and served with a peach sweet and sour sauce. This is a common place for people to just hang out as well. 
	

=== **Government** ===
	**Council hall. **Runewood has no formal government, whenever something comes up it just gets discussed at the council hall,  which is a massive amphitheatre dug underneath a rather chunky oak. The entire town can fit in there, and does so when necessary for protection. An old wizened orc named **Berg **holds the knowledge of law, though she has several apprentices.
	
	**Workshop of the Worlitraw. **The Worlitraw tinkers with bushings, bearings, hinges and plates in his workshop. There are tools aplenty, though many have strangely unnecessary swivel points, including the notoriously horrendous #7 flathead screw driver, which has an phenomenally efficient rotating head and no mechanism to control that rotation, such that it is nearly impossible to actually turn a screw with it. **The Worlitraw **has eminent power over Runewood, and uses it to avoid having the town fall prey to courtly shenanigans. **The Worlitraw** maintains that he is actually a temporary fixture until a better fey comes along to take his job.
