====== Fey Outside of The Feywild ======
Created Monday 20 September 2021

==== The Springer ====
	One of the oldest fairies, the most mercurial, and one of the most powerful. The Warden of Lightning themself is perhaps one of the only beings that could truly harm **The Springer.** In the old tales of many worlds, The fairies are a metaphor for the power, danger, and beauty of nature, Inclusive the people who tell the stories. An appealing field near a cliff has been the death of many a child, as has not being prepared for a long journey with bread and silver, or not harkening to the words of whatever religion held sway, or daydreaming too long, or not paying attention. At the heart of these tales is so often **The Springer, Archfey of Danger, and truly beyond mastery **in the Court of Terror. **The Springer **was often the one who placed that field, or made a temptation, or created a waterfall or spooked a horse, or lead bandits to a road. **The Springer **Offers only one lesson, and exchanges favour for safety and grants favour for wisdom. **Be Prepared. **For the fey are tricky, and can be anywhere and anything.
