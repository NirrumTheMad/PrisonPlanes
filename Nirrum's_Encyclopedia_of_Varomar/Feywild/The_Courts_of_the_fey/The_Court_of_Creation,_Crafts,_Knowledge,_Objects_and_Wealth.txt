====== The Court of Creation, Crafts, Knowledge, Objects and Wealth ======
Created Friday 14 August 2020


The court of lore is one of the strangest of the courts by nature of being the most familiar. The fey in this group are crafters of objects. Machines, shoes, carvings, dictionaries. Because of this peculiarity, they don't necessarily require favours, as their favours //are// material goods and exchanged services. It has been proposed more than once that all humanoid species and most creatures of the humanbonkers realm are fey of this type, but I am assured that this is not the case, though it does appear to be true for **gnomes. **By this nature, they are bound and bind with... well.. cages, chains, physical restraints. 


To a creature born into the Court of Lore, physical forces are what govern the rule of favour. The tightest curling of forces, the most abstract limits of their mathematics, the most distinguished curl of ink on a page, all stand to nourish them. A Lore Fey's craft is craft itself. Skill in the workfolkship of any object that lasts beyond their hands. They have the most solid works of any fey and care the least for promises
 


==== The Stonestands ====
	In a Dizzying peatland, the Stonestands are the home of the **Neriadniclu, Archfey of Beginnings and Endings. **The stonestands are easily spotted as a garden of vines and 10ft tall cylindrical statues. Among them stalk hags and mages all trying to glean some form of prophecy. They are unlikely to find it, as the statues, all of archfey. tell only of their beginning and their end, and their end is almost invariably "ran out of favours to give". Stalking a grassy hill near one side of the swamp is The Neriadniclu. 
		
		the **Neriadniclu,** Archfey of Beginnings and endings,  WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE WRITTEN UNTIL THE END BUT OF COURSE IS THE FIRST FUCKIN ONE ON THIS LIST



==== The Clockwork Castle And Tower of Lightning, Jukagacgon Dalri ====
	Built in a blasted plain on the stormy side of the morning, a Nacrous green castle with copper beams and trim stands watch around an impossibly tall standstone tower. The castle is filled with sounds of ticking and quiet but ponderous gears turning. The Clockwork castle houses seven vast machines, all warded and presided over by the **Lord of Wiles and Stone, The Gammunacteries Rayl. **The Rayl, the archfey of sequences, is the one who decides what crafts can be made real. They hold a very powerful place among the fey as a governing body used to deter certain horrors from emerging in the feywild. The Rayl is the only creature that can speak with **the Warden of Lightning, Archfey and ruler of the court of Lore. **The Warden of Lightning is an immensely powerful being that bestows raw inspiration unto the fey. They are the portal through which much of the magic of the feywild flows. They exist beyond the comprehension and power scales of most beings. In the eyes of the gods, the warden of lightning is as a sword, less powerful in a broad sense, but nearly indisputable in others. They sit within the tower of lightning, which acts as a gutter, allowing the magic that flows from them to enter the machinery of the clockwork castle, from which it disperses into the feywild.
	
	The Seven Machines housed in the clockwork tower each serve a different function, originally there were six until the potency of the vital pump was revealed to be useful to more mortal creatures
		* The wheel of the self-contained concept is a wide device of incredible efficiency that can make certain types of magic apply nearly permanently to certain items. This is power beyond what can be found in the phb.
		* The Pendulum of duality has two functions. It can either invert the function of an item on a conceptual level or double its capacity, but can only do so once in each direction, and its effect depends on the direction the pendulum is currently swinging. If some aspect of the item is doubled, it becomes highly unstable, and has a 1 in 8000 chance of simply ceasing to exist at any moment (three critical failures in a row). The item cannot be boosted past a +5, nor can the pendulum boost the damage of a spell or an ability that a creature has. Inversion is best interpretted by the dungeon master with the advice that it is a conceptual inversion, it doesn't need to make perfect sense, but just enough. Sovreign glue can become either a terrifying explosive or just universal solvent.
		* The Vital Pump is a strange conversion device that originally wasn't one of the seven, as it is barely useful to the fey. The Device can double your remaining lifespan at the cost of half of your hit point maximum and vice versa.  The exchange is permanent and cannot be undone by anything other than the pump short of 10th level magic as you are //rewritten.//
		* The Residuum grinder is a set of eight two-tumbler grinders with increasingly fine sets of teeth that is used by the fey to utterly destroy magic items. The grinder works especially well at destroying legendary  items but it has some difficulty with artifacts. It cannot destroy anything created by the "Create seal" spell, or any other sealing artifact without advanced other rituals. **The Gammunacteries Rayl** may decide to help if the artifact is likely to draw one of the horrors from outside the realm. The grinder produces Residuum, a handy material roooooughly its weight in gold, with the massive upshot of being very easy to work with in making magic items. There is some loss and the grinder produces about 75% of the amount of residuum that would be required to make the ground item. 
		* The Garcrystalline Manaphone is a 128 tone cylinder. 8 honer, 6 Resonator, 2 mode Manaphone. Made from garcrystals, a magical and generally brittle crystal that appears to be breathing (thought it is just experiencing a slightly excited state) when activated. The crystals have a sort of four dimensional chirality such that magic passing through them can be thought of like a chain of sausage links, where the sausages continually inflate and deflate with each sausage being at its peak inflation when either  adjacent sausage has appeared empty for quite some time. When oriented Parellel to a magical field (exhibiting 1,2 left, and 3,4 right waveforms), the crystals will vibrate gently. Activating one of the 128 Tone cylinders, giving a rough waveform output of the energy density per second per second of a given magical field. The 8 honers can be used to eliminate crosstalk in one of 256 possible configurations. The six resonators can translate a massively wide section of the magical spectrum into wavelengths more understandable by beings of our energy states, capable of capturing wavelengths as long as some universes all the way up to near theoretical spatial maxima. The Resonators  also serve as limiters, and are very tough, and might not break through even divine intervention, though, **The Gammunacteries Rayl** has had to replace broken resonator plates twice as eldritch abominations greater than the comprehension of even the most powerful beings that can be spoken about in words came too close to the boundaries of this layer of the Far realm. If oriented perpendicular to a given magical field (or intersecting), the crystals instead light up as they vibrate, and the resulting waveform produced by the Manaphone can be used to reproduce or reanalyze any such magic. This can **allow specific forms of some spells to be translated into academic magical forms. In essence, allowing wizards and artificers specifically to learn spells from other classes given enough time to study. **It is worth noting that **The Gammunacteries Rayl has a special room for examining spells, **and requests that any experimentation that he allows is performed in that room in order to keep the machines safe.
			* //Nirrum's note: OK that's something I need to tell people once I get back, that's really handy//
			* **Dm's Note: **Healing spells, sadly won't work this way, Spells that require an intelligent analisys of the current context and customized responses **can **be read this way, but will only be able to replicate that exact result.  Spells such as Speak with animals, hallow,  and tree stride are all free game. Of the spells that resurrect, Revivify and Raise dead are the only ones that work, as they do not attempt to heal wounds. Guardian of Faith and Contact planar ally and similar spells that require communal with gods *can* facilitate communication but might also draw the ire of any given planar entitty.
		* The channel and preliminary diffusers are several systems of magical conduit and massive spinning wheels through which flow condensed athaumatic Mana. This was built in the early days of snarl by the gnomes brought in by **Thenagarurokamon, ** with the intent of reinforcing the prison by absolutely soaking it in powerful magic. There's not much that this machine can do for adventurers  or pilgrims but if you open the pipe and stick your hand in it and you're a caster, you get all of your spell slots back at the cost of one level of exhaustion. Non-casters might find themselves able to very termporarily cast low level paladin , warlock, or sorcerer spells, an effect that fades after about a minute. 
		* The Clock is the final of the seven mechanisms, and incorporates much of the castle in its working. **The Gammunacteries Rayl** uses this clock as the ultimate shield against  impending destruction. The clock under the guidance of the Rayl as well as with the aid of the warden of lightning is capable of stopping time for one creature or entity indefinitely, with only casts of **Superior Disenchantment** being capable of removing it. Thankfully this is usually enough to cause some greater abominations of the far realm to turn away from this layer. **The Warden of Lightning** tells the Rayl that stopping time is no different than an urchin with poison spikes on the ocean floor to these abominations. What is lethal to one is an inconvenience to another. 

	**The Warden of lightning is too powerful to really describe here, The concepts of swords or magic exist in states so far below their existence that there is no reason to include stats. The Warden of lightning, Ruler of the Court of lore apparently can only be described as a hypermetagnome. **Hypermetagnome, a word which exists exclusively to describe the Warden of Lightning, is a hyperintelligent sapient being that exists as a seies of thoughts composed of interactions  at high energy states within the incredibly dense magical field that  flows through them. They are closer to an incredibly powerful spell than they are any sort of creature. **The Gammunacteries Rayl** still describes them as inquisitive, somewhat insensitive, and a deep learner who delights in facilitating exploration where they can, though their interactions don't function as direct boons or magic, but as series of favourable or interesting events that may happen at various points throughout time and space //particularly// around this prison plane. Despite this, their most useful "location" is at the top of the tower of lightning, named such because, despite numerous lightning rods, it does keep getting hit by magical lightning.
		//Nirrum's Note: Turns out lightning rods actually prevent lightning from striking normal buildings by normalizing electric potential. Neat. //

**The Gammunacteries Rayl, Archfey of Sequences, lord of wiles and stone **(INTP) Court of Lore, (Patron, Fey)
	This strange  creature looks relatively elven but with deep red skin, yellow hair, three legs, a green shirt, a blue robe, and purple overcoat
		Height: 8ft
		Influence: Perception (Intelligence) or Arcana (Charisma) 25 to solve a magical problem that consistently floats about the  Rayl, being the one he's working on
		Favour:4410
	The Gammunacteries Rayl is sour but brisk and official. He takes his job very seriously. He does not have time for much humour as he has to listen fairly frequently for the lightning. He Does not often barter in favour, save to access the machines. If someone manages to influence the Rayl, he'll Grant them the Action surge feature from the fighter class. If the person already has action surge, they gain an additional use of it. The Rayl is capable of casting 12th level magic with relative ease, and is the surest bet to solve a problem, but to do so, he must be influenced and the threat must be planar. The Gammunacteries Rayl still requires the costly material components  of the spells and rarely has any on hand. He is also notable in his other title, the lord of wiles and stone. The Gammunacteries Rayl has extreme control over sequences, bordering on omnipotence, which he doesn't really use, save in two instances. He is entirely immune to deception as well as the shenanigans of the court of whispers, and has the uncanny ability to shape solid stone to perfectly suit his purposes. While he can almost certainly do other things with this power, he simply doesn't.
	

	


==== Gnomeshop ====
	//Nirrum's note: Finding this place officially makes me 10x more hip than Mordenkainen//
	 
	In a cold and snowy region near the noonside of the feywild is the mighty Gnomeshop. The steeply sloped A-frame is dotted with chimneys and vents. Medium-sized red doors  set in the external logs of the building are nearly always open as gnomes cart  materials and projects in. The Gnomeshop is the true home of all fey gnomes, wether they remember that or not. Many gnomes throughout the ages have been born on the prime material and figured out their way into the gnomeshop on their own merit. Impossibly complex machines of magic and material are composed within these halls regularly. This is where the most physical of the fey gifts come from, and the gnomes are more than willing to sell them to players for rare ingredients provided they get the approval of **The Euratsatni, Archfey of deeds, Godfather of the Volcano. **
	
**The Euratsatni** (ENTP), Court of Lore (Archfey, Artificer Battlesmith 14) 
	This strange human-looking thing wears a long white-fur-trimmed coat, often green, blue or red, and has a habit of knowing when someone has been a bad person
		Height: 5'6
		Influence: Good aligned deeds on average over the last year.
		Favour: 1440
	It is not that this white-bearded being can read minds, but that upon seeing a creature, simply //knows //whether or not it has been relatively pro-social and "good" for the past year. Those who fail this test get beaten with a staff, and those who pass are given a small gift, often in the form of food or clothing, but not uncommonly toys. The Euratsatni can procure any item that would remind a person of their most innocent and carefree times, and will gladly produce such items for anyone willing to get them into the hands of the people who need them
	

==== Bunsharina ====
	Bunsharina is home of the Bunsharinan, a hunchback with dragonfly wings and baggy white silk pants who is unashamed of their form in a powerful way, as if shame could never visit them
	

==== Library of Shears ====
	Home to no one but constantly filled with Korreds. This Large standstone structure sits in the afternoon side of the feywild, upon the standstone from which it was carved. The cieling is a woven tarp of glass made from korred hair that gleams diffuse sunlight into the library below. Here, lined on hooks held on boards, sorted in rows, are shears of every material the korred can find that can cut hair. Every Alloy, Every level of purity, Everything that can hold an edge. Korreds throng to this location to cut their hair with materials they may need. The Library is run by **The Conzequoneuraeuramesthtiin. The Archfey of indices, Caretaker of the shears. **An adventurer who comes to this place will not only be able to get a stylish haircut for a favour, courtesy of some practice Glamour fey, but also, if they make a donation of an unusual set of shears, they may take 1lb of hair from a visiting korred with shears of their choice. This comes with a warning to choose wisely, as some shears are made from ideas, strange magics, toxic materials, and on occasion, elemental forces themselves. Thieves here tend to meet with quick and painful deaths by animate iron cord made of Korred hair. 

		**The Conzequoneuraeuramesthtiin, (ISTJ) Archfey of Indices, Court of Lore**
			This grey, scruff-bearded creature has the appearance of a gnome, but with a head the size of their squat body, both twice the size of a human. 
				height: 20ft
				Width:  15ft at the shoulders and jaw
				Influence: 200,000gp
				Favour:1210
			This squished creature has pallid grey skin, massive sleepy amber eyes that almost seem to pop out  from either side of his large and long nose, and an ashen, almost light blue shadow of a beard. He looks tired and sounds like nothing you will say will change anything about the situation. The ruler of Indices appears perpetually bored, and the utmost humour from him is a wry smile that makes one feel like their joke is perhaps not as original as they thought. **The** **Conzequoneuraeuramesthtiin **is a creature of bureaucracy and is constantly filling out the paperwork to index and record the state of shears in the library. He does have a weak spot for Fine whiskeys and other strong complex alcohols, enough to pucker his usually sedentary face. For such a drink, he offers favour in the form of dancing a jig, or the much more commonly taken option, A single full list. The list contains the enumerations of any given request, provided it can be listed. Whether that be a recipe, a geneology, or a list of names of conspirators. **The Conzequoneuraeuramesthtiin **does place a reasonable limit on these requests, keeping them to one layer of information deep and to within a thousand items, and he will tell someone if they have been payed off (influenced) to not reveal the information. The Archfey of indices is a decent sort, polite, and more or less married to his job.
			
			//Nirrum's note: //While the blurb above may seem harsh, as another Librarian, I have nothing but respect for the Caretaker of the Shears. **The Conzequoneuraeuramesthtiin** may //seem //like a neutral individual, but those who run publically accessible libraries  are those who wish others to prosper.

==== Gamblebrumbus bush ====
	The Gamblebrumbus bush, also known as the Horditordi tree (by less civilized fey, I'm assured),  is a large, woody bush, approximately 10ft tall, and with a 5 foot gap under its canopy. The Gamblebrumbus bush produces Horditordi fruit, or Gamblebrumbus pears (by less personable fey, I'm told). Eating one of these nuts redoes time in a strange and silly way, such that a person can find themselves with an ever so slightly different set of skills. A Character who eats a nut can change their subclass to another one in the same class, losing the benefits of one and gaining the benefits of the other. The Character who eats a nut retains their memories unchanged, but cannot make functional use of the knowledge they possessed, and any functional knowledge quickly atrophies. Character who eat two such nuts can retrain any number of skill proficiences (as well as reassign expertises or similar things) to any others, including those that aren't part of their class or background losing the benefits of one to move those benefits onto another. Characters who eat three nuts can reorder their ability scores. Characters who eat four nuts FIX THIS  Characters who eat Five such nuts die. Characters who eat six such nuts can reroll all (or if recorded, any) of their hit die. Characters who 7 nuts are never seen from again //usually. **Druids of the Circle of Dreams** seem to be able to return after eating 7 nuts, and those that do gain the ability to locate other characters that have eaten seven nuts.** Characters who eat 8 nuts can completely reroll/remake their character up to their same level and experience and value of equipment. **//Characters that eat more than 8 nuts are bonked on the head sharply and not allowed to eat any more nuts, though in rare cases, one can eat 10 nuts, and then they will have eaten no nuts. Characters must wait a month before partaking of the nuts again, or they will get a tummy ache and die, usually in that order. 
		The Gamblebrumbus Bush (or Horditordi tree) is overseen by **The Pippirizzer, Archfey of The Gamblebrambus Bush and/or Horditordi Tree, as well as extraneous contexts, subtle influences, and other such things. **Accompanying the Pipperizzer is a small horde of pixies, fairies, and other smaller fey that frequently alter details of their life, occasionally becoming different species in the process.
	**The Pipperizzer, (ISFJ)  Archfey of Stuff that didn't seem like it was big but was, Court of Lore** (Circle of Dreams druid 20)
		A bald pale green head and curious blue eyes peer above an evergreen beard from which two three-fingered hands emerge and two ten-toed feet. 
			Height:1'4
			Influence: A jar filled with a minimum of 1024 origami paper cranes 
			Favour: 4000
		The Pipperizzer is old, wise, and particularly helpful to children. They smell of sage and bread, and are sympathetic in nature. The pipperizzer has absolute authority over the gamblebumbus bush and the horditordi fruit, and grants favour in the form of the nuts. The Pipperizzer also grants favour in the form of one's own story. These stories are told such that they feel like a fairy tale, and awaken memories that the person did not know they had forgotten. Often the Pipperizzer grants these stories before people know they are redeeming a favour. The Pipperizzer offers favour for those who visit children with bad families. Often the Pipperizzer will appear to adventurers and ask them to give an item to the child, preferably secretly. Often a piece of chalk, a stuffed animal, a coin, a latex ball or a seed that occasionally jumps. Those things will lead the child back to the Pipperizzer, either by walking them to him or making a door out. He tries to find them a good new home but is poor at it. It is not Uncommon that children get brought to the Wizened Grannard
		






==== **Runewood** ====
	Sitting somewhere in the cool midmorning is one of the few settlements of prime material folk in the feywild. This is home to the Aulufeydth orcs and the green knights. Runewood isn't large enough to be a city, a few thousand residents under the guidance of **The Worlitraw, Archfey of Contact Surfaces. ** Houses here vary wildly in size, from grand mansions to small huts, often next to eachother. Each house is limited to the height of a tree nearby, and is allowed to be no taller. As a result, the largest houses are not only the oldest but built near Spruigia. Different families will maintain different types of tree, from all over the feywild. To cut down a tree tied to a house in this place means death to the person who did it and pretty much everyone associated with them.

	**The Worlitraw, Archfey of contact surfaces (ESFP) (**Fighter Cavalier 11) 
		This noble and honorable fey is entirely encased in a bumpy suit of black armour that completely obscures them
			Hieght: 3'11
			Influence: Acrobatics (strength) 18 to spin 5 times in one push
			Favour: 1210
	The Worlitraw speaks in a high pitched (bad high british) voice and is enamoured with acts of valour, despite being a fey of lore. He wields a lance and always counts as mounted as his heels have two metal wheels on each side of his pointy and curled toed sabatons, which autonomously rotate to drive him forward. The Worlitraw offers favour to those who bring technology made with bushings, bearings, hinges, cogs, and any non-fixed contact surface that has been made with a check of 22 or higher. For Favour, the Worlitraw will  gift a person 30 tiny applications of// The ultimate lubricant//  which is made of **hypocritical helium**, which is supercritical helium, just magically at room temperature and with a higher surface tension. It has the marvellous property of making any surface nearly frictionless for hundreds of years. Alternately, he will alter one melee weapon within the person's posession to have a +4 to attack and damage rolls, replacing any other bonus, but not other magical effects. Finally, He can grant the Knørra rune to anyone who knows the magic of runes. 
	


==== Cogkeep (needs marimbas) ====
	This is the prototyping area for the clockwork castle, whirring and clacking away in a pile of machinery left in the deep night. Many lore fey still work here, as the prototype machines still partially function, not usefully for most purposes, but  for the purposes of the **Mortamankia, **and his cadre, it offers plenty of insight and room for work. The gears are efficiently turned by ambient magic, but their design is flawed, meaning the cogkeep is quite loud, and perception checks made to hear here are made with disadvantage without spells or outside of a few special rooms. Where the clockwork castle is clean, effective, and safe, the cogkeep is a winding maze of "I guess this will have to be a hallway, watch your step" and "keep your hands close", and other such hazard warnings. The cogkeep is mostly under the mastership of the **Mortamankia, ** though a few other fey, such as **The Skillogintan ** And the **Heesilockloly **make their home in its winding depths. 
		//Nirrum's note: I find this place quite calming, despite the clamour. It's most of the draw of the more lawful planes without having to dismantle a modron infestation every few minutes.//
	
	**The Mortamankia, Archfey of engineering (ESTJ) **(Artificer 14, armorer)
		One of the most accomplished fey, an archfey proven after being born twice
			Height: 7ft
			Length: 15ft
			Favour: 1960
		What was once a reasonably shaped pixie has been slowly replaced, piece by piece by an intriguing crawfish like construct, leaving only a stretched face as a remnant of the original being. Through dangerous trades and clever design, the Mortamakia has put their limited capacity for favour entirely into their new body, provably their work and works are those of a high favour fey, and by nature of their conquest, they are a well accepted archfey, for clearly, they were not born themselves and thus, were clearly not done being born. An Archfey of metal, hatched from a pixie. The Mortamankia will grant favour for detailed plans to a complex or clever machine, and for favour will make custom "dancing" melee weapons (eg Dancing sword) of any size.  For residuum or gold worth the standard cost, they can also put any other applicable enchantment on the weapon in conjunction with its dancing status. These don't need to be melee weapons either, and the Mortamankia uses this mostly on wrenches which will tighten a bolt on a bonus action. 
		
	**The Skillogintan, Archfey of Chronoception (INTP) **
		A bit bitter about not being in the clockwork castle, but willing to wait
			Height: 1ft (beard excluded)
			Favour: 2890
		Situated under a sapphire dome on the top of the cogkeep is the Skillogintan, a very short gnome-like creature with a long twig-like nose, upon which are perched two large round spectacles. They wear a blue conical hat about as high as they are, and a matching blue robe. Their nearly white beard is easily three feet long, and their moustache extends half a foot sideways off their face. They grip a staff with an hourglass on the end which occasionally detaches to flip itself over before reattaching. They smell of burnt toast. The Skillogintan is a distant mystic who is rather surprised whenever they have visitors, as they never expect anyone so suddenly. The Skillogintan will offer favour for Petrified creatures, and will redeem favour for **Advanced Chronoception. **A character with this ability can either choose to slow their perception of time up immensely, gaining two exhaustion levels when they return to normal, or speed it up, Passing time rapidly without getting tired (or recharging abilities). In both cases a creature still ages normally, it is just their perception of time that changes.
		
	**The Heesilockloly, Archfey of Infusions, Teas, tisanes, and other plants in water (ISTJ)**
		A severe but large fey with round eyes, a round body, and a large cleaver
			Height: 5'5 - 10'5 when angered
			Favour: 1440
		Making use of the Cogkeep's perpetual movements, The Heesilockloly grinds herbs and uses stressed metals to heat water.  They have their black hair tied in a bun, keeping it out of their large round eyes, which are both marked with red lower lid eyeshadow-like pigment. Their bare chest bears symmetric black markings that suggest flame and occasionally move. They wear yellow pants and have thick but somewhat short legs. Their arms are large and muscular, though proportionate. Their cleaver is large and rectangular. They will prepare tea for guests without requiring favour, and they will give favour for anyone who brings them new plants to brew. In Return for favour, the Heesilockloly will brew any potion, or give a list of the raw ingredients. Protocol must be followed around the heesilockloly. Greet them first, then bow, then sit only when a seat is offered.
		
		

==== Mount Colossus ====
	Half-reclining in the beginning of the late afternoon, among a particularly dense forest on an ancient bedland is Mount Colossus. It is of course, no real mountain, but the yet still figure of a construct or being of barely describable size. The colossus is the shape of an orc, with its longer arms, short but pointed ears, and immense tusks. The colossus' face bears only one feature beside its mouth, and that is a single eye, lidded sideways, open and staring into the sky, unmoving but clearly searching. At its hip there is an empty scabbard, suited for an appropriately sized curved sword (a smithing tools (intelligence) check of 12 will determine the form to be akin to Khopesh, Laz bichaq, or some Sosunpata.  The Mountain is half-sitting on the ground, holding itself up with one arm, while the other reaches upward into the sky. Indeed, its size is so large that to see the whole structure, it must be a very clear sky, and you must view it from far away. The Structure's shoulder is where one  can find the **Sunyengumthi, Archfey of Solutions and Solutions. **To reach the though, it is recommend one bring a ladder, as it is necessary in order to navigate the crags of the skin of the mountain. The mountain is, for all intents and purposes, just a mountain, but creatures that try to dig into it frequently just disappear, never to be heard from again. The mountain secretly is a creature of the far realm, embroiled in politics beyond the comprehension of mortals or indeed, most immortals, and that it looks so familiar is a mere coincidence in an ocean of circumstance.
	
		**The Sunyengumthi, Archfey of the solved and dissolved (ENFJ)**
			A  Lion's head on a skeleton built of bones that look like twisted vine
				Height: 7'9
				Favour: 3240
			**The Sunyengumthi** has a dull grey mane that moves like it is under water, shifting in some invisible flow. Their eyes are vibrant purple and lavender, set in a greyish-green face. Even in the harsh winds and thin air so high up, the smell of baked bread eminating from their structure is  overpowering. **The Sunyengumthi**, has wild eyes, perpetually excited, almost at the verge of erupting, but speaks in a low, smooth growl with slow words. They will grant favour for a DC 24 Arcana check to unravel a complex Arcanochemical formula, and will return that favor with fey salt. **Fey Salt** is a chemical compound of interesting properties. If used to season food, it not only tastes better than any of the halide salts, but has the curious quality of allowing someone to know the full history of whatever they are eating that was alive in its most recent form, from conception to death, as if they lived that creature's life. It is also phenomenally useful in high level divination spells. If mixed with raw powdered octarite and distilled water, it creates a delayed blast fireball whose bead lasts two days before exploding on its own at three times the spell's original radius. Alternately, the **Sunyengumthi** can increase one's intelligence by 2 and intelligence maximum by 2

==== Desellemachonia's Gardens ====
	Far into the deep Autumn of the fey, Perched in the ripe morning is a wide set of fields, orchards, paths, and patties. pumpkins go here
