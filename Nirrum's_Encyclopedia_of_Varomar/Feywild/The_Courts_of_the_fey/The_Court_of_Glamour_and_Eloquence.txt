====== The Court of Glamour and Eloquence ======
Created Sunday 23 August 2020


The Archfey of the court of Glamour and Eloquence are powerful, and All use their name unchanged. 
Set among the darker regions of the feydark mostly, 



==== The Stonestands ====
	In a Dizzying peatland, the Stonestands are the home of the **Neriadniclu, Archfey of Beginnings and Endings. **The stonestands are easily spotted as a garden of vines and 10ft tall cylindrical statues, 


==== Darkbar ====
	In the feydark, just off a stageroad is the darkbar, the darkbar is the anti-xanrans. The length of the bar is arguably infinite, and there is always a bartender nearby, though one always has to wait for at least one other person to be served before you are attended to. The bar takes only favour, though the quality of favour doesn't need to be high. They will only take regular currencies  from fey of the court of lore, particularly gnomes, though they are a bit spiteful about it. The bar is always smokey, and smells of tobacco in a rather inoffensive way.  They serve every type of mundane drink, composed of fey magic, and usually of high quality, though, the atmosphere is what makes the darkbar a place to go. along the wall opposite the bar are Divot booths with tables and long chairs for groups. In one of them sits Thorcurin  Archfey of Tongues. 


		**Thorcurin, Archfey of Tongues (ENFJ)**
			This pale skinned eladrinesque man is all about taste, both literally and metaphorically
				Height: 6'0
				Weight: 210, mostly muscle he assures
				Influence: Intelligence (Brewers supplies or Cooking Utensils) 30 to produce a magnificent flavour
			Thorcurin has pale blue eyes with purple radial heterochromia. His hair almost matches his skin colour and his shirt is never fully buttoned up. Those who accept a drink, Food, or other services from Thorcurin owe him a favour, and he has so many that he can give out his name freely. Thorcurin is a powerful chef, brewer, and procurer of the second finest ingestible items on snarl and many of the planes around. Thorcurin is Loathe to admit that he's been thoroughly bested culinarily by a common mortal cook, but unwilling to lie about his position. Thorcurin can create or replicate any meal for a favour and, for a sufficiently good favour, have it delivered. Thorcurin has made //many// siofra, and is patron to //many// warlocks




==== Silverfall Castle ====
	In the deeps of the feydark where the shadow pools deep and campfireweed blossoms and starflies are the only sources of light, a wide mirrorlake, the widest in the feywild, opens into a round chasm that plunges into the underfey. Sitting on a floating island with no bridge above the depths is silverfall castle. A building of mirrors of different shades in greyscale, the castle is hard to navigate or comprehend. Herein sleeps **The Quindylade, Archfey of Mirrors. The Quindylade** inherited the castle from **Aralc, Archfey of eyes** when she left for the Prime material. The castle is capable of reflecting anything, and there are many places where a creature that walks into a wall will simply walk out, facing the opposite way. Creatures can find that their handedness has permanently changed if they don't step carefully. Unseen servants will cater to anyone in this hall, until the **Quindylade wakes up.** The Quindylade will only wake up if the sun shines through the castle, which is presently impossible. Nevertheless, if it happens, the castle itself is capable of teaching anyone any single illusion spell that they then know, can cast with any ability score, and counts as a class spell for all purposes. Usually, the spell people learn is lower than 5th level, and often quite random.
	
	The **Quindylade (ENFP) Archfey of Mirrors**
		This huge black doglike or drakelike creature  has a mouth lined with polished silver and a gullet that glows prismatically
			Height: 17ft at the shoulders
			Influence: Sleight of hand (charisma or wisdom) 12 to get the castle move to your defence, 
		The Quindylade pines for Aralc, but knows she won't return any time soon. She is depressed, hungry, and craves favour in the form of lost reflections. In return, she teaches powerful abjuration spells, and can give them in the form of silver slivers that permanently carry the effect of one spell, though these break if they are ever exposed to a mirror. The Quindylade is playful but wrathful, and she is very quick to anger, though easy to flatter.
