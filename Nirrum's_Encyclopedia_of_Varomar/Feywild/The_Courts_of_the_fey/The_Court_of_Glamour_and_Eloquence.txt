====== The Court of Glamour and Eloquence ======
Created Sunday 23 August 2020


The Archfey of the court of Glamour and Eloquence are powerful, and All use their name unchanged. 
Set among the darker regions of the feydark mostly, 



==== The Stonestands ====
	In a Dizzying peatland, the Stonestands are the home of the **Neriadniclu, Archfey of Beginnings and Endings. **The stonestands are easily spotted as a garden of vines and 10ft tall cylindrical statues, 


==== Darkbar ====
	In the feydark, just off a stageroad is the darkbar, the darkbar is the anti-xanrans. The length of the bar is arguably infinite, and there is always a bartender nearby, though one always has to wait for at least one other person to be served before you are attended to. The bar takes only favour, though the quality of favour doesn't need to be high. They will only take regular currencies  from fey of the court of lore, particularly gnomes, though they are a bit spiteful about it. The bar is always smokey, and smells of tobacco in a rather inoffensive way.  They serve every type of mundane drink, composed of fey magic, and usually of high quality, though, the atmosphere is what makes the darkbar a place to go. along the wall opposite the bar are Divot booths with tables and long chairs for groups. In one of them sits Thorcurin  Archfey of Tongues. 


		**Thorcurin, Archfey of Tongues (ENFJ)**
			This pale skinned eladrinesque man is all about taste, both literally and metaphorically
				Height: 6'0
				Weight: 210, mostly muscle he assures
				Gain Influence: Intelligence (Brewers supplies or Cooking Utensils) 30 to produce a magnificent flavour
				Favour: 2560
			Thorcurin has pale blue eyes with purple radial heterochromia. His hair almost matches his skin colour and his shirt is never fully buttoned up. Those who accept a drink, Food, or other services from Thorcurin owe him a favour, and he has so many that he can give out his name freely. Thorcurin is a powerful chef, brewer, and procurer of the second finest ingestible items on snarl and many of the planes around. Thorcurin is Loathe to admit that he's been thoroughly bested culinarily by a common mortal cook, but unwilling to lie about his position. Thorcurin can create or replicate any meal for a favour and, for a sufficiently good favour, have it delivered. Thorcurin has made //many// siofra, and is patron to //many// warlocks




==== Silverfall Castle ====
	In the deeps of the feydark where the shadow pools deep and campfireweed blossoms and starflies are the only sources of light, a wide mirrorlake, the widest in the feywild, opens into a round chasm that plunges into the underfey. Sitting on a floating island with no bridge above the depths is silverfall castle. A building of mirrors of different shades in greyscale, the castle is hard to navigate or comprehend. Herein sleeps **The Quindylade, Archfey of Mirrors. The Quindylade** inherited the castle from **Aralc, Archfey of eyes** when she left for the Prime material. The castle is capable of reflecting anything, and there are many places where a creature that walks into a wall will simply walk out, facing the opposite way. Creatures can find that their handedness has permanently changed if they don't step carefully. Unseen servants will cater to anyone in this hall, until the **Quindylade wakes up.** The Quindylade will only wake up if the sun shines through the castle, which is presently impossible. Nevertheless, if it happens, the castle itself is capable of teaching anyone any single illusion spell that they then know, can cast with any ability score, and counts as a class spell for all purposes. Usually, the spell people learn is lower than 5th level, and often quite random.
	
	The **Quindylade (ENFP) Archfey of Mirrors**
		This huge black doglike or drakelike creature  has a mouth lined with polished silver and a gullet that glows prismatically
			Height: 17ft at the shoulders
			Influence: Sleight of hand (charisma or wisdom) 12 to get the castle move to your defence, 
			Favour:1690
		The Quindylade pines for Aralc, but knows she won't return any time soon. She is depressed, hungry, and craves favour in the form of lost reflections. In return, she teaches powerful abjuration spells, and can give them in the form of silver slivers that permanently carry the effect of one spell, though these break if they are ever exposed to a mirror. The Quindylade is playful but wrathful, and she is very quick to anger, though easy to flatter.  

==== Balemorn Citadel ====
	Positioned where the sun is precisely halfway above the horizon, the White and Green Towers of Balemorn Citadel give a view for the lord of the morning
	
	
	**The Lliavalri, Lord of the Morning, Archfey of Wintergreen and crisp scents (ESTJ)**
		This Enemy of the Autumnal fey is dressed in ermine fur and teal suede and speaks briskly
			Height: 5'8
			Influence: 3240
		Perpetually smelling of bright acids, alcohols, savoury, sage, mint, and wintergreen, the Liavalri is a busy fey. Almost indistinguishable from an average elf, the Liavalri is most notable for his purple skin below his neck, all of which he keeps covered. The Liavalri considers the arguably benign discoloration a disfigurement contracted at the hands of the Horachibald during a dispute. The Liavalri  procures favour in exchange for things of his soft ecru-golden-green aesthetic. Things such as cane sugar, bitter teas, and white furs are all things he's willing to trade for as well. Though his greatest prize and the only thing he will give full favour for is a jar of not uncommon but hard-to-produce chemical called Geosmin, which he needs to woo his beloved lady  **The Harlannenna, **of the court of Valour, Archfey of the rains (And what we do in them)


==== Gunenmu Sillowdar, Castle of Glamour and Eloquence ====
	White columns set in black strapping and Gold croquets keep the contrast of this building high. Walls of emerald in a motif of a single swell wave set against iolite skies. Dusky iron domes cap the symmetrical towers  that run toward the centre of the building. The cleverly flared towers look to have perfectly parallel sides when seen from the ground, having the effect of making the ground look farther away when one is in one. The windows are set with thick Gold tracery that is angled with Curlicue to catch the light. The front doors are Dark jade set in similarly dark grey marble. A silver path leads to the door and seems to melt into the ground. Gunenmu Sillowdar is in the midmorning parts of the autumnal feywild so the light can cast shadows deep enough to put another dimension to the contrasts of its design. It is smaller than the other castles of the fey courts, but no less complex. Each room within is  made of stunning architectural choices and eye-catching colour schemes. Muqarnas, Frescoes, Arcades on wildly varying columns that present spaces with increasing vastness. The impossibility of fey architechture is taken to incredible peaks in the castle, as prime material guests are often given very small rooms only to find on their journey to the bed that there is, in fact, a complete arboretum  within the room. Within the castle are some of the most powerful glamour fey, though notably two are missing.
	
	**Ylla Sillowmin, Archfey of Fame, Lord of the Court of Glamour and Eloquence (ENTJ)**
		Ylla Sillowmin wants nothing more that to see you struggle with a simple word until she springs it on you
			Height: 5'4 (but larger than life baybee)
			Favour: 6760
		While Undoubtedly possessed of many forms, Ylla Sillowmin seems to favour a specific set characteristics. She appears almost entirely humanoid, She wears a bright pink feather boa, with intermittent orange and red feathers. Her white shirt is sleeveless, and she wears unnecessarily dark glasses,reminiscent of the brow of a horned viper. She has a bare midriff, which is layered with bright pink stripes, interrupted by a green lightning bolt shape. This only appears to be her skin, and not magical. She wears a long pink  skirt which looks like it made of layers of gauze and glitter. She smells of some sort of fruit or resin, and the ostentatious level of edge is offset by her extremely bubbly and confident personality. For once, the form follows function, as her grim levels of pink match her ludicrous power. She is a patron of unheard of levels of warlock, and indeed, seems to be the most prolific in offering pacts in all of the feywild. She teaches lessons of Efficacy in action readily. Many of her warlocks do not go past first level because of the quality of her advice, and how she teaches discretion. To my knowledge she has no Siofra. For spreading her name (an unheard of thing within the fey) she will grant favour, and a substantial quality. In Exchange for favour, she grants extreme fortitude in the form of **Sillowmin's Boon. **A creature with this boon can take another level of exhaustion  before they begin to take negative effects (starting as normal). Additionally, they add twice their proficiency bonus to skill checks made with one skill of their choice.
	 
	The **Zanzenzunzin, Archfey of frissons and goosebumps, (ENTJ) (Fey sorcerer 13)**
		This Striped, spotted, and winged Pixie is human-sized and great at opening jars
			Height: 6'
			Favour:  1690 
		With one of the most disarming smiles in the feywild, The Zanzenzunzin is the most capable of delivering immediate sensation. They are a master of illusions, delivering cold shivers, light caresses down arms, and the various sounds that appeal. They  seem to be quite fluid in their presentation, switching between masculine and feminine but never losing their wings, stripes or spots, which luminesce in vibrant colours when they speak. They will take a goosebump, frisson, or shiver inducing experience in exchange for favour, returning a different one in kind, or teaching the spell Frisson Static such that a creature always has that spell prepared and it does not count against the number of spells they can prepare in a day. The Spell counts as a class spell for the creature being taught. The Zanzenzunzin Speaks in a whisper except when the opportunity to join a choir presents itself. They smell differently to each person who smells them, but the result invariably sends a shiver response. They are loathe to speak of the Zon, but are unable to get rid of him.
		
		The **Zon, Archfey of the sublime, INTP **
			Nothing this Nearly transparent pixie does is done in a hurry.
				Height: 1ft
				Favour: 4000
			The Zon is either one of the hardest working fey, or the laziest. It is hard to tell. They are barely visible //by choice//, their voice is deep and resonant, though they barely speak. The world around is difficult to feel uncomfortable in, though this is localized to whatever space he is working in. The Zon does not need a shape but presents as a pixie when things need to be actually physically done. When meeting the zon, you involuntarily either gain 4000 favour and lose something you won't notice is missing, or owe 4000 favour but gain the ability "**Unconcerning aspect**". Once a day as an action, you may activate your unconcerning aspect, which lasts for ten minutes, until you end it as an action, or until you attack a creature, cast an obviously harmful spell, or produce a distracting or harmful effect of any kind. While this effect is active, creatures cannot actively attempt to percieve you unless you are the only creature they can percieve. Your stealth checks can only be opposed by passive perceptions, so long as there is an ally of you within view or earshot of the creature you would be percieved by. In crowds of 10 or more creatures, you are impossible to identify as an individual regardless of your appearance, though can still be targetted by spells. The Zon smells exactly like the vicinity within 20ft of him. He is a fun-loving creature that particularly enjoys confusing people in ways they probably won't notice for hours to years, such as changing the colour of one's shoes, Switching one's Eyebrows, or putting freckles behind people's ears. This fun-loving nature is not to be confused for weakness, as **The Zon** is a powerful patron, and their magic ignores resistances and immunity to charm and fear, installing the necessary faculties in a creature if need be. The **Zon **is capable of casting **Mass suggestion at will** with a spell save DC of 20. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw do not notice the spell has been cast.

	The **Melololidi, Archfey of Colours (ESTJ)(functionally light cleric 16)**
		It is difficult to look at this assuredly humanoid creature through the overwhelming light they produce.
			Height: 4'0
			Favour: 2560
		The Melololidi understands colour in ways that scholars still struggle to understand. Wherever an eye takes in light, she can draw power, and indeed, she radiates this power constantly. While the Melololidi is childlike in stature, she is extremely capable of potent acts of strength and magic. She is quite vain and will, without regard for safety, will, consent, or biological possibility **magically repair visual organs, creating new ones if the creature lacks them, and building the brain structure to interpret the stimulus. **Normally this would incur a debt on her part, but any hint of pleasure at her colours is taken as debt in the reverse. By an elder decree, she can only gain such involuntary favour once per day, so it is best to come with some extra, or to have a similar trap for favour. In much more voluntary exchanges of favour
	
	The **Wendhariramonknihuai Archfey of Jewels (INFJ) **
		 A very large dragon, though small by mythic standards, Through whose wings, a great rainbow of colours splinter and spread.
			Length: 69ft
			Favour: 4410
		The **Wendhariramonknihuai **is a dragon whose scales seem made of amber, under which, musculature and vasculature can be seen. Their wings are feathered like a great bird's, though each feather is some solid through which various light can shine or can refract and reflect brilliantly across. Claws of Nacrous paua, Teeth of pearl, and an amethyst tongue. The **Wendhariramonknihuai **smells of dusty slate, and sounds like rain on a tin roof whenever they move. The **Wendhariramonknihuai **is a soft-spoken dragon, their voice barely a whisper.  They will accept rough gemstones as favour, as they want nothing from the college of lore and creation directly. In exchange for the rough gems, they will offer one of the following items:
			An Amulet of Magic, which allows the attuned creature to cast spells. This effect cannot be stopped by an antimagic field
			A Ring of Spell Attraction, Which makes the attuned creature the target of spells that you are within the range of
			A Torc of Splendour which magically makes anything you wear seem reasonably fashionable to any creature that is not immune to charm effects
