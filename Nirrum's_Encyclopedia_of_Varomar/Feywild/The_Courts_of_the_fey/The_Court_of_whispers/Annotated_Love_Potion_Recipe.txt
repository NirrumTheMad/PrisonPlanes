	//**Base**//
		40oz of Ethanol placed in a medium copper retort	
		2 grains of octaride, Stir with glass, not magic, until dissolved or vibrating 
			//one is fine, octaride  is hard enough to get. Vibrating octaride means arresting the merchant after, but it will still work.//
		Mirri's Mixture, 2 drams
			//Mirri, queen of college cocktails buy a bottle, drink half, use the rest//
		Add all together, stir for 8 hours heating at 80 degrees, filter out undissolved octaride
			//78.4 degrees for better output.//
		Should yield 10oz of product
			//12 if you don't overheat//
	
	//**Additives:**//
		2 grains of sulfur
		12 grains of iron (II) oxide
			//Mixing in Iron (i) oxide causes further reaction, and you don't want to be their therapist if that's the case. You'll have to knock them out and start from scratch after detox//
		silver Capsule
			//This isn't the dark ages and you've got ten doses. Give them a flask and add a bitterant so they don't get addicted.//

	//**Medicinal:**//
		1 oz sunwort tincture
			(1.2) //some patients may become suicidal with this, check to see how they react to sunwort beforehand.//
		2 grains Amphetamine
			(2.4) //probably not necessary if the sunwort works. //
		10 drops of Mistaken Oil
			//12 if you don't overheat. I shit you not, don't even check the supply closet, only ever check the looms among the bluer pigment, they always have it, it's from the fey and the looms have connections//
		1/4 oz unicorn blood
			//Or just pan fry some onions in butter and use the juices for the same effect and less damage to the kidneys//
		1 clove of garlic
			//Aulu for life//
		1 good joke, to be read upon consumption
			//A druid who bathes//
