Silver and burgundy
Liar so fair, 
That we could be wed
should we but dare

Silver and Burgundy
why must you go?
Must I be cold this winter?

I was troth to thee
I was your wife
I was your herald
I was your life

Silver and Burgundy,
why are you gone?
Why am I cold this winter?

You left me for something
that you did not say
You could not describe
why you went away

Silver and burgundy
I'm all alone,
Where is my lover this winter?

One month together
that's all we cound spend
you left on an errand 
and that was the end



Silver and Burgundy
Why do I stay?
Where are you now this winter?

(//Nirrum's Note: There is a record of a lost verse, which was uncovered about a hundred years ago, which is omitted in most versions of the song//

//Green, Gold, and Ivory//
//I bring you a deal//
//an emerald ring//
//with paua of teal//

//Green, Gold, and Ivory//
//Give me the dawn//
//so I may give to my lover)//

Silver and Burgundy,
I'm dying alone
The cold touches me
I'm chilled to the bone

Silver and Burgundy
this is my grave,
a house that is filled with winter.

Copper and Caramel
I've brought you the dawn
Kept in a bottle
how long was I gone?

Silver and burgundy
Eight years it has been
Never leave me again.
