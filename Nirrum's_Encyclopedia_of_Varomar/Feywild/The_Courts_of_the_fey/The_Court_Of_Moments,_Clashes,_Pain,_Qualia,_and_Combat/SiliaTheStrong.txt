====== SiliaTheStrong ======
Created Friday 08 April 2022

This is the tale of Silia the strong
Who punched the folk who did her wrong

Silia was a child of ten
who had had no arm and paper skin
Her back was hunched, her eyes were dull
Her teeth barely fit inside her skull

The other folk that lived around
pushed the girl onto the ground
//"You are hideous and weak, //
//just die!"// They'd say
and silia would cry as she ran away

Silia asked her gran for hope,
Who made her living making rope,
and her gran gave her good advice
Go north and cross the river twice

Once near the stone from Hally's mill
Once near the bridge under the hill
Then Climb the tree in Downy's yard
There sing a song of kings and guards

Then climb back down and lift your nose
sniff for sea and run where that goes
There you'll find a flowering pine
With petals that smell like Nardin's wine

Go beneath it's western side
Find the path it tries to hide
Follow it along the bluff
and you'll know when you've done enough

Silia did as her grandmother said
the next day when she rose from bed
She crossed the stream and climbed the tree
And sang the song and smelled the sea

She found the pine and then the path
she stiffened like a scything snath
For there was no coast so near her home
but waves here crashed and filled with foam

She followed down along the cliff
until her legs were sore and stiff
and there she found a temple hall
Where nothing should have been at all

She went inside the walnut door
and found a being of a curious sort
His colour changed form every side
He was like a child of her height

But his arms were strong and his face was strange
and he had the power to shape and change
Whatever thing that gave her pain
so that she could feel whole again

Silia thought then she'd said 
as the fairy listened and turned bright red
I'd have an arm, that ne'er would fail
and skin as hard as dragon scale

I'd clear my eyes, and fix my teeth
and have a head with a neck //beneath//
but most of all I'd like a friend 
who'll be there until my end

The fairy said "I can do these
But you'll have to work here as I please
For five long years you'll have to toil
to clean the baths that always boil

To scrape the ice off of the pool
from where the water meets to cool"
And Silia said she'd do her best
and the fairy said, he'd do the rest

So silia worked for a quarter score
and then she worked a little more
to learn the ways of those kind fey
who came to visit every day

When at last she left the temple spa
She thought again of her grandma
and left beneath that same pine tree
That stood on the cliff above the sea

When silia stepped on Downy's land 
far from the sea, far from the strand
summer swept it's humid breeze
The same she felt before the seas

She hurried down her hometown lane
burst into her home "I'm back again!"
her parents stood in disbelief 
They almost took her for a theif

the spitting image of her gran
two strong arms, her height in span
her voice the same, but her eyes shone bright
her gran said she'd only been two nights

She kissed her mom and hugged her dad
who thought they'd both gone raving mad
When Gran had said "It was that fey
who lives not far, down in the bay"

Silia gave her gran hug
that lifted her up off the rug
and thought of what she had in store
for those who mocked her long before

The next day she went down the lane
and found the folk who caused her pain
and with her newfound strong right hook,
she threw those fools into the brook

She definitely broke an arm or three
and punched somebody's front teeth free
She gave one boy a solid whack
and ne'er again could he straighten his back

And no one bothered silia again
except for her secret oldest friend
a man whose face was very strange
and whose colour seemed to always change.
