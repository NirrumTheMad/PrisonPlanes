====== My Garden Has A Secret ======
Created Monday 26 September 2022

My garden has a secret
That none of my friends know
I planted a hundred flowers
In terrace, row on row.

I planted Turqoise Lillies
I planted jumping Thyme
I planted Opal Everlasting
Iemon, linden, and lime

But among the tall mage iris
a sunrise blossom bloomed
I did not plant this flower
in this garden that I've groomed

My husband died three weeks ago
And yet my heart beats well
because the flower in my garden speaks
the words that keep me hale

It tells me not to run from grief 
but embrace it well and long
hold it like my husband dear
who's not a fortnite gone
