	Aye, it was my gran. She told me stories about Great granpa, how he... how bad he was. She says it was when she was young, the late 5660s, bit of a stretch when you don't have elf in ya, but it happened. She says she found a piece of chalk in a field. Neat little thing, I still have it here, it's a little worse for wear, and I guess it only worked once because It never got me out of a jam neither. That night when Great granpa was on the juice again, she says she drew a door on the wall under the bed. There were only two rooms in the house after all, and great grandpa was in his chair in the kitchen near the hearth. She says  that as soon as she touched the chalk to the brick that was the back of the hearth, she knew she needed to draw a door, just a little one, just big enough for her to get through. Just as she finishes she hear the bottle smash and Great granpa start hollerin'. Almost didn't notice the brick split where the edges of her door was. Behind those bricks there should have been fire, and outside was winter, but there that little hatch opened, it was spring, she could see fiddleheads  and snowdrops. She shuffled in that hatch quicklike, 'cause great granpa was already peakin under the bed t' grab her. Well she slipped into the hearth and out of a tree, barely fast enough to get out his grip, but she was safer in there than she was with him, thas' all she knew. She plodded out along, lookin for shelter, says she couldn't figure out what a day was worth, because the sun never went in the same direction for any turn. She wandered and wandered until a funny little rabbit man found her sleepin in a field where the grass talked, told her bedtime stories. She says she never slept so well in her life, nor woke with more of a fright when he talked. She was always on guard with great grandpa, but the rabbit man asked her about where she came from, and she was careful bout answering. "Are you be having someone to come get you Childling?" She says he said. Always put on a funny voice fer that. Funny voice she said he had, squeaky and squawky. She says yes, her Uncle's coming to get her. She h'ain't seen her uncle for years, he went off to get rid of some kobolds an' never came back. The bunny says "well then you'lling be will waited for hisself in the propering spotter!" and says she's to follow along with him. She gets lost she says, two or three times, when headin straight didn't mean what it should have, but the rabbit man came back for her and made her follow close. He brought her to a scary canyon and told her to close her eyes and not open them for anyone or thing until he says so. She does, squeezes her eyes so tight she got a headache and a little hand grabs on to hers and pulls her along a path. Tells her to lift her leg high to get up some step, tells her to hold on when she glide across what she thought was ice, then path, then wood. Then the rabbit man tells her to open her eyes. She's in a cabin with a bunch of other kids, and she ain't never seen other kids before, and this little ol' lady. Gran says she could tell the old' lady was a witch, but she doesn't know how. The witch says that gran can call //her// Gran-nan, or Grannard if she wants to call her anything. Gran ain't sure of what to do, but another lad grabs her hand and gives it a good squeeze. Gran w'ain't used to that. So she pulls her hand away and the lad looks hurt something awful. Gran-nan says to gran "come little lady, let's take a look and see what we can do to fix you, lest you catch grimfever" and takes her outside. Gran-nan's hand doesn't feel bad to hold on to, said gran, something about it didn't feel like anything human. She takes her to this circle in the ground, Gran made one like it in her garden after, loved to sit on a chair in it, staring into the sky. Gran-nan says "drink this first child" and hands her a little cup. Cider. Gran almost threw up when she smelled it, but she did as she was told rather than make trouble. She said she felt like she never breathed so deep as after she drank that cider. She no longer had the shudders. No longer saw folk what wasn't there. And rarely had a nightmare ever after that! Gran-nan says "now look up, see where it is what hurt you." And gran looks up and sees a hole in the sky and sees her dad and gets right afraid. Gran-nan says, "Someone should deal with that one... Later, come along deary" and brings her back inside. This time she decides to grab the hand of the lad who greeted her first, and well... That was Granpa. Blubberin mess he was. Gran never really tells the story after that, says it'd be wrong to tell it, just that one day, her uncle actually came to get her. She remembers his smile, little gap in the front teeth, says my brother looked just like him. Shaved, sharp jawed,  Wavy hair, grey now, t'wasn't when she saw him last, Dressed fit for the woods and carrying a sword what talked. Says he almost cried himself when he saw her. He took her out and away, said she'd never have to go back to her dad's. Her Uncle was a wanderer, but he bought a house at the next town with a lot of kids and stayed there with her for about seven years. In that time she learned all manner of witchcraft. By her uncle's clock, she was 20, but she looked like she was 10 when she came out of Gran-nan's. Didn't bother her much. One day she went back, found a crack behind a tree she says, and slipped into that world where the sun moved wrong. She went back and got Grandpa from Gran-nan. He was still young and she had something to do. She left him with her uncle and went back, found her dad's shack 'cause she looked at the hole in the sky again to know where it was. She took us to see it once. Now it's mostly cracked but she says she could see herself reflected in the glass that the ground turned into when she stopped throwing magic into the fire. She said she slipped into a fairy ring and stayed about in the otherworld while she learned more witchcraft. When she came out, she and Granpa where about the same age, though he was a little older lookin, big bear of a man, grew like a maple while she was out. They were married a year later when the town got spooked of her witchcraft and Grandpa promised he'd deal with it... heh, he dealt with it by marryin her and said if anyone spoke bad of her, he'd  let her deal with them. She was a good woman, Gran, real careful to never yell at us. Got angry a few times, sure, she had four kids and seven grandkids, and there's a time and place to snap. When she got mad, the room just seemed to shrink, glasses would break, sometimes the fire would go out. That usually snapped her out of it, definitely set us straight. She took care of her uncle until he died. Never really aged herself. She set off on her own after grandpa died, never saw her after that. She never aged much, last I saw her, I looked older than she did. And it was her and him that made our family name what it is. I took my husband's name, but my brother and most of my cousins still go by //witchguide//. Harny went to visit Gran-nan himself once. Came back jumpin and cursin, and said he couldn't do it, couldn't get far into the rift where gran-nan was, covered in unholy magic he said, not like he was ever a churchgoin sort himself. You can have that chalk if you keep it safe, I was never good with magic anyway, and I don't think there's anything left in it.
