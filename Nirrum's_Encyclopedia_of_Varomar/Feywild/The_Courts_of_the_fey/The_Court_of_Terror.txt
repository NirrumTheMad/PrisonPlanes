====== The Court of Terror ======
Created Monday 24 August 2020





==== Cauldrona Canyon ====
	Entering this canyon is a spiritual journey, as many places in the feywild are. It is one of the few places where 90 degree angles get you their expected results.  The Canyon is the work of a being called **Gran-nan, **who is the **Archfey of Old Traumas. **The Cauldrona Canyon is only a mile long and filled with magical Rain. The rain falls in thick blots that obscure any form of vision, hearing, tremorsense or blindsight, limiting it to 20ft before nearly all meaning is lost save in noted exceptions and dramatic moments, other than points of bright light, which can be seen for up to 100 ft.  **Gran-nan **guards, or rather, lives next to **The hole in your dreams.** A stone Dias next to **Gran-nan's House** marks the location of the hole. The rain never falls on the dias, and if one looks upward, the hole in the clouds reveals an inky black abyss. Staring into, listening for, attempting to smell, or reaching for the hole reveals the exact location of all major elements of each individuals own worst memories in their most consistent form. The person who killed one's parents, the corpse of a spider that crawled across one's face, the house one was born in, the house one died in, the house one left part of themselves behind and what remains of that. The parts of the memory can be explored and selected. The less horrible the memory, the less clear it is. This interaction can instantly cure and repair Retrograde //and// Anterograde amnesia, among other long-term memory disorders, curses, and spells. A person can choose one feature of their memory, even obscure or metaphysical aspects and be given a clear and understandable location. If there are special instructions required to enter a location, the map will provide one option, though not necessarily how to achieve it. It is not cryptic, but it does not solve problems. A specific pattern of actions required to unlock a spell is easy, but the response to getting to a floating island is simply "fly". The memory of this location and these instructions remains permanently clear so long as nothing interferes with the memory of the trauma which also remains clear and so long as the object or concept is present in a meaningful form. 
	
	
	
	**The Cauldrona Experience:**
		within a few moments of entering the canyon safely, the party will first smell rotting and putrefying flesh, 
		As they progress, the source of the smell becomes apparent, a large elk-like creature lies with most but not all of its pure white fur eaten away, exposing its flesh. 
			its eyes, which are on the sides of its head are permanently open with one of them staring at the party. The same side of its face has been chewed away revealing its row of sharp teeth, Something black drips from its lips (it's tar)
			It is writhing very visibly with maggots, which begin hissing if the party comes close at all. If anyone comes even closer, the maggots begin crying, a sound not unlike human children
			If the party interacts with the corpse in any way, the body thrashes, then stands up, lets out a pained bleat  and runs off into the rain with a movespeed of 60, and it uses its dash. 180t later it slams its head into a wall, dashing its brains on a stone and continues to attempt this if stopped.
		As the path progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the cliff walls that line the canyon contain fossilized children of many races en masse, some of them reach out from the wall, their tiny hands skeletonized. Among the children's skeletons, are larger, giant skeletons of horrible proportions. Many of the smaller skeletons lie  where the guts would have been in these larger ones
			Against one wall there is a fully adult hand reaching out from the shoulder of a barely visible infantile skeleton barely hidden behind translucent stone. The hand is fresh and a backpack and bedroll are on the ground. If disturbed, cockroaches erupt from both and scatter, often remaining hidden among the party's belongings (attaching to an item and remaining imperceptible until that item is inspected or used)
		Along the centre of the canyon, a solid, uninterrupted and uniform strip of stone serves as a path emerging from stony rubble, a ditch with muddy water flows alongside. Drinking the water gives one a rather acidic and metallic taste. Should anyone spit out the water, a small black tadpole attempts to squirm back into the river, where it becomes undetectable, a faint smell of smoke is on the wind. **If someone can speak to beasts, then these tadpoles all speak like children who are in the middle of playing a massive game with all their friends.**
			shortly after the road begins, sheltered under a tree are three fresh elven bodies, one with a mutilated face that is lacerated with glass around the destroyed maxilla, one lying down writhing with black tadpoles that crawl out from holes all over their skin, in particular around their face which is unrecognizable from the holes which never seem to overlap, and one kneeling over it with a shortword buried in their stomach. From the wound of the kneeling elf, more black tadpoles writhe and as the party looks, their eye erupts and another tadpole falls out onto the ground, trying to squirm toward the river. There are four bedrolls and four adventurer's kits on the ground. Their fire is still smouldering, their wood too wet to catch in its current state. 
		The road-like strip stops abruptly with a change of elevation, with the ground rising quickly nearly 4 feet. A nearly perfect round pit sinks into the ground. The pit has no known bottom. around the pit is a steep clay bank, about three feet  high. The pit is easy to avoid but one can't look *down* the pit any signficant distance without being on the crumbly slope. There is a DC 5 Acrobatics check to not slip  and a DC 5 Athletics check to not fall in after slipping. A character that falls in the hole is stuck there without aid from something that can fall faster than it does or something that can teleport.
			Behind the top of the  rise, A sleepy goat rests. If a character climbs the ledge, the goat panics and attacks the character in a surprise round (provided it is not already spotted), trying to use its charge attack. Instead of knocking the player prone, the goat pushes them toward (and if possible into) the pit, where they make the same saves described above. A character that is unaware of the goat that gets a higher initiative gets advantage on the save.
			If the goat gets killed and doesn't fall down the hole, maggots quickly begin working their way onto its skin.
			If no one is looking at the pit, a scuffing sound can be heard followed by a feminine scream that quickly fades, as if something had fallen in. A broken foot-long campfire skewer rests on the bank of the pit.
		After the elevation change and goat there is a massive, reddish black pond that lines the canyon from wall to wall. The water is cold, dark, and ripples from the rain obscure the surface. The pond is 150ft across. Swimming through the pond isn't spectacularly difficult but a constitution check with a DC of 10 is required to avoid gaining exhaustion. Visibility is low in the water, about 3ft maximum. The pond is 50ft deep at its deepest points, the bottom a mixe of white rocks and slimy mud
			If the characters choose to swim, halfway across, one member must make a DC 15 athletics check or be pulled under the water's surface. Another Athletics check or Any damage at all to the thing grabbing them will free them. If they are unable to free themselves, they begin drowning in 1d10 rounds, and will go unscious after an additional 1d4, three rounds after which, they die. At the bottom of the reed pulling them down, is a round, wide face with round, small-pupiled eyes and a thick-lipped, wide toothy smile. Upon inspection, it is a mask. The Mask, if retrieved, is painted wood and cursed, and the character permanently loses the ability to recognize faces as faces seeing them instead as the grotesque, knobbly and not infrequently pallid mounds of claylike flesh they are. Any form of Pareidolia ceases for that creature, and while they will be able to recognize the part of a creature that is a face, it will always feel alien and out of place. A Greater restoration or Remove curse spell removes this effect permanently from the cursed creature. 
			If the characters choose to fly over the lake, A flash of ligthning reveals that the entire lakebed is in the same shape as the mask mentioned above. At this point, flying characters will notice some of the raindrops are actually black tadpoles
		Shortly after the pond, a dense but relatively short  forest  starts. Upon the evenly spaced trees are apples. The apples inevitably all have Tawny worms in them. At the base of many of the trees are writhing matts of worms, feasting on apples.
			The apples are relatively bitter with only a mild sweetness, they are quite astringent and dry out one's mouth.
			Underneath the matts of the worms are occasional bones of varying sizes but no sign of equipment
		Behind this orchard is A long, single-floored wooden house in a rough L-shape. This is The House of **The Wizened Grannard, **the archfey of old trauma. She is always friendly, perhaps too friendly, and will offer travellers applejack, a sour alcoholic beverage made from distilled apples, With her are a crowd of children of different races. After speaking with the players for a few sentences, **Gran-nan ** asks the children to go sit in the basket they want to be in. When they are all settled in, she turns all of the children standing tightly together in each basket into **either black tadpoles, tawny worms, or pale white maggots. **She will then ask the travellers if they want to help her bring the tadpoles to the pond, as she can get the worms herself, and the maggots always seem to know their own way. She will explain with a toothless smile that all of the wriggling things in the canyon are lost children. Until they decide to die, leave, or until someone comes to pick them up, they can live in this canyon eternally, in cool rains, abundant apples, and without much fear of things that can eat them. 
		**The only thing that can enter the canyon and harm the children are sapient, thinking creatures, and browsing herbivores that are nearing death.**
			If any of the wriggling things has been eaten, Gran-nan sighs but smiles. "There are so many here, It is inevitable that some of them die. I hope you chewed well though, Children are tough, and sometimes a half a child can become two full ones and those rascals are always hungry, you know how children are." She then laughs a wicked laugh. 
			Gran nan changes the children into small things to save on space, as she has millions in her care
			Gran nan says that you can only take out the child meant to go with you.
			Gran nan reveals the walls  of the canyon are hungry too, and have their own guardians to protect the children, the giants who eat wayward adults who tarry too long in the canyon.
			Gran nan offers guidance in her limited capacity, and when the party wishes to leave, she'll draw a short door with a piece of chalk on the wall of her hut. She'll then stick in a branch or spoon or some sort  of crook that can be turned and open the door, revealing the entryway to one of the buildings in one of the other courts, a much more welcoming place. She says that the door isn't a very good one, it doesn't like to open a second time. She will absolutely give away a single piece of chalk as a gift, which can link any two places that the player has been, provided that they have been invited and that at some point in both places, they felt comfortable. The door can only open once, after which the chalk is nonmagical....unless they want to become a wriggling thing too. A player can draw with the chalk anywhere if they wish to visit  Gran-nan again.
			**Gran-nan claims to know nothing of the roaches, they shouldn't be able to get into the valley at all. She'll have to go look later.**
		

	
	**The Wizened Grannard, or Gran-nan (ISFP) **archfey, Terror, (fey magic sorcerer 15)
	A tiny humanoid woman with a squat face and Cinnamon-colored skin that guards lost children... perhaps
		height: 4'0
		Influence: 19 Investigation (Wisdom) to recognize that your experience is part of her weave 
	The Wizened Grannard is an undeniably skilled witch. Her eyes are not visible in their sockets, as the skin from her face simply seems to have engulfed them, leaving the thinnest of slits to indicate that she does indeed have eye sockets, if not eyes. She has no teeth and wears a simple brown robe. Her voice is crackly with vocal fry and high pitched. She Gives good life advice but in a macabre way, usually adding parts on to advice that imply that not taking that course of action would be Catastrophic or lethal. "Yes yes, always use your manners when speaking to pretty men, They'll be more likely to talk, and you won't have your tongue stolen by a Wusslebarg." "You should get your armour oiled or it'll rust and squeak and then one of the skulks will find you and steal your soul and face so they can trick others into making the same mistake."
	If attacked, she disappears completely with a cackle, leaving a pile of empty clothes on the floor and her hut silent. She will never appear again to those that witness this. The Wizened Grannard accepts favours in the form of lost children, and grants favours in the form of her apple cider, which can cure PTSD's more uncontrollable symptoms, such as flashbacks, tics, and nightmares.

==== The Font of Unwhelming ====
	Out of reach of the light of the sun, despite its position in the noontime regions, there is a pit. Several massive  white roots pierce the ground on the way  down into the pit, **as of 5854, they are streaked with red. ** Should one venture down into the pit, climbing down the treacherous bramble of  thick criss-crossing roots, they will be  able to reach the font of unwhelming.  Liquid emotion condenses here, too powerful for mortals, caustic to all but the most powerful fey. This liquid is useful for creating golems, as a drug for creators and artists, as a poison that can breifly stun any creature that isn't immune to being charmed or frightened, and as a source of magic for paladins, sorcerers, and certain warlocks, but interestingly, not bards. The font is guarded by **The Enamel Scale, the archfey of erosion. **Smaller fey deliver sacks of teeth  to the Enamel scale in exchange for favours

	**The Enamel Scale** (INFJ) Court of Terror, Fey Snake/Mirage Dragon, (Green dragon Wyrmling stats, minus fly speed + a fear/hallucination skill?)
		Length: 125 ft
		Influence: 18 Medicine (Wisdom), you must identify the wisdom teeth among the scales
	Description: A giant snake, scaled in teeth, with opaque solid pink eyes, which resides in a circular pool of water, who’s surface is never disturbed, regardless of what falls in or touches it. Her scales are patterned ever so slightly, similar to those of an albino ball python, with yellow and white teeth alternating to form the pattern. Her own teeth are a collection of mammalian carnivore teeth. The pool floor itself is littered in cast-off blackened, rotted teeth, though the pool is never clouded by the muck. Humanoids who still have their wisdom teeth when they encounter her owe the serpent a favour, however they can annul it by offering the teeth up.


==== The Estuary of Wide Jaws ====
	In one of the cooler areas of the morning in a misty cove at the end of one of a long river is a wide delta that is part mangrove, part grassy swamp, and part tidal flat, which gives way to an intense drop into the fey oceans, reaching extremely deep. Stepping into this place is near certain death, as it is the home of **The Perolossani, Archfey of Aquatic Jaws, **a name which makes much more sense in sylvan. This lord of the water holds sway over predatory fish and other creatures  with sharp teeth. Muskelunge, Sharks of all sorts, Barracuda, Pirannha, Quipper, etc; all creatures of their domain.
		
		**The Perolossani, (ISTP) **Court of Terror, (marilith but with teeth instead of swords)
			Length: 50ft  
		This sea serpent bears the red and black head of an eagle but the beak has been replaced with a thick-lipped mouth hiding thousands of needle-like teeth.  Two arms with seven-fingered hands reach from its silvery blue scaley body and a long, sail-like fin extends half of its length. The Perolossani grants favour for 200lbs of fresh raw meat from a beast, and redeems favour in the form of an item called the **Mermaster's Purse. **This Shark egg case is large enough to fit two medium creatures inside. Once a day, two creatures  can spend a minute inside the purse and emerge with dorsal and brachial fins, a long tail with vertical flukes, and the ability to breathe underwater. They get a swim speed equal to three times their movement speed and immunity to pressure, heat or cold while within liquid water. Going back into the Purse removes this effect 



==== The Skullpit ====
bugman
	In the afternoon, deep into the autumn, cut into the centre of a storygrass field is a quater-mile Crevasse, from which a horrendous stench pollutes the surrounding landscape. 



==== The Wilderkilm Experience ====
	 Wide quiet forests in the pale late morning   spread out from a crumbled old fireheart, barely a translucent circular hill poking out of their canopy. It is the quietest place in the feywild that sound can still be heard in. You know when you've reached the Wilderkilm when you hear your heart and footsteps only. There are no paths.  To navigate the Wilderkilm, one must not talk, not through voice, through gesture, through telepathy. There must be no communication. If you speak or say something in any way, you invoke the ire of, and owe a favour to, the **Aucholemery.**
		There are trials for the wilderkilm


**The** **Aucholemery, Archfey of Stillness**

	A Pair of Almond shaped emerald green  eyes speckled with blue and white sit in a dark skinned but slender face with a Smile that always shows sparkling white teeth are all that is even remotely humanoid of the Aucholemery. Scales with deep grooves reminiscent of long burnt wood, black and streaked with white near edges run the length of a large lizard-like body. Long Monitor claws grip the ground and propel that shimmering smile forward, only to stop her without sign of momentum when she is in range to work her magic. She grants favour in exchange for a gallon of holy water, A holy magical item, or other blessed or consecrated goods. She redeems favour with a few abilities
		**The eye of the basilisk: **As an action you can force a creature to make a constitution saving throw against a DC equal to your level or be petrified for one hour or until you end the effect as an action. The use of this ability recharges after a short rest
		**Perfect stillness: **As a Bonus action, you can anchor yourself perfectly still in whatever position you are in, similar to an immovable rod. A creature attempting to move you from  this position must make a DC 30 strength check to do so. Any Damage you take in this state is postponed untily you leave it, at which time it all applies simultaneously. The state lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action. The use of this ability recharges after a short rest
		**Deafening Silence: **You can cast the spell silence at will. 
		

Holy and sacred place, even for the fey who barely know of such things. 


==== Tellimardun hy Treysa ====
	In the Morningside regions, a deep forest  of seemingly normal trees beckons travellers with sweet flowers, fruit, and a serene sense of beauty. This is the Forest Home of Dryads, and is ruled by **the Verdant Queen,** who slumbers inside a great white ash tree, around which no creature can feel animosity or, close up, any emotion at all. The Ash Tree is one part of Treysa, the great white world tree of Snarl, though she is only a small part of it, as this tree connects to all other world trees. The Verdant Queen is the custodian of the fey side of such things, and as a result, she is one of the most powerful fey in the multiverse, nearly as powerful as the warden of lightning or the springer. The forest reflects the Verdant Queen's mood and it is very quick to change, Save when she is around her husband, the Shymbalaeo, Lord of the court of Valour.
		
		**The Verdant Queen, Matron Of Dryads**
			The Lady of Leaves has little humour, and plenty of time to crack stone to get her way
				Height: 19ft
				Influence:  Nature (strength) DC 21 To wriggle your arm between roots in the ground as you kneel, and touch the cool water below.
				Favour: 7840
			A nude humanoid of imposing height, **The Verdant Queen** betrays her fey nature with her feet which resemble the trunks of trees. Her hair is filled with and perhaps made of leaves of Jacaranda and Mesquite, with occasional flowers for each and matching scent. Her skin is a silvery grey. She is of modest figure, though her eyes are deep ruby red and it is difficult to look away from them. She is terse and loathe to grant favour at all, save for those who will use her power to save trees, particularly those with dryads. She does not care for the dryads emotionally, but this is her place in the world, and she will fulfill that duty with immense ferocity. That said, she will grant favour to anyone who saves a dryad from death if that dryad informs her of the deed, and she will also grant favour to anyone who brings her a gift from her husband. She redeems favour by planting a strong dryad tree of the type one wishes in any climate, in any location. The tree will bloom and produce fruit in all weathers and at all times of the year as long as the dryad lives. 



==== The house of Fable, Myth, and Stories, Lueri Unshinihi Castle of terror ====
	At the edge of sunset, in the idle orange sunlight, one can find a long, stone pathway that passes through arches of silver, vined with honeysuckle. This is the entrance to the castle of terror, the Lands of the lords of Terror, and among the most influential fey. Every step down this path  gives a new image, each representative of one of the powerful fey of the court of terror. The Path is also the demarcation between the summer and winter fey, whose struggle defines other courts of the fey elsewhere. Here on snarl, it is how these fey operate, and not some ambiguous moral stance that defines them. The house of Fable, Myth, and Stories is a beautiful log cabin when seen from the outside, but every step along the path towards it advances the season to winter and the sun towards setting. To step off of the path is to thrust yourself along the feywild, through aeons and worlds and universes, through hundreds of instances of experience. To leave the path that leads to the house of fable is to get irreparably lost, as sure as death. A Single blink will separate you from anything familiar. 
	**GM's note:  Character death.**
	There are Five places on the path where one can safely enter and leave. The entrance to Snarl's Feywild is as described above, but three of the others are more complex. After 13 arches of honeysuckle, where the leaves begin to turn, one can find **The Mizzuraer, Archfey of Collection and Reaping. **
	
	Further down the path, 30 arches in, if you leave the path and head to the Log Cabin from the side, you will find **The Logoch, Archfey of Fading Senses.  **The Logoch sits on a bench on the flat of the lawn at the edge of the garden. An old, dark-skinned man, hunched over and with Twiggy antlers poking out from behind his ears. One of his eyes is bright hazel with a cat's pupil and a crimson Sclera, veined with green. The other is sky blue, though slightly clouded. **The Logoch **is curt, and will offer favour for the removal of a sense or for gifts of creatures and plants that can produce intoxicants or poisons. For a favour, the Logoch grants a permanet boost to stealth and deception, though he is loath to give it. This bonus is equal to the recipients **charisma score. **Alternately, he can ensure one dies a happy death, but one should be warned against this fate with the line: Bliss comes from Ignorance.


	Further still down the path you'll find **The Creyhundeeth, Archfey of Careful Action in the Face of imminent Disaster, preparation for coming trouble. **The Creyhundeeth is a tall, Crablike creature, cloaked in black. Their Legs are extended to their full length beneath them, and only just visible under their long robe. At the end of their long arms, humanesque hands with pinching claws where each finger should be grasp a staff in one hand, crooked and Gnarled. at the front of their very crablike face, a large, thick pair of Mauve lips  and toothy smile greets their visitors. They are pleasant to talk to, and speak in a deep voice and smell of rotting leaves and damp earth. They speak of careful preparation and  delight in having those who prepare for disaster be able to use their preparations. They stand tall  just at the edge of the last fading light. The sky above them is always overcast, and no stars nor moon ever cast light upon them. Their eyes are yellow-hazel, which is made all the more shocking by being crab eyes, compound and stalked. Favour is hard to discuss with them, as the court of terror is so long-thinking with their ideas, and **The Creyhundeeth** is perhaps among their most farsighted. On the Creyhundeeth's hill, one can gain favour by seeking guidance, and one can redeem favour for a single item, that if managed carefully will save what one cares for from destruction. This items varies from context to context. There are no guarantees that a person themselves survives what the item protects them against, but **The Creyhundeeth **offers assurances that very few people die from their gift, though, they add that a few people are rather quickly killed by their gift, as they are the ones who pose the most threat to their ideal future.
		//Nirrum's note: When I stood upon the hill, under the influence of Nirrum's Interuniversal Scrying, a spell of my own design. **The Creyhundeeth** gave me a pen, and warned me not to run out of ink. Then, strangely, both to me and not to me, it told me to make backups. //
	
	
	And at the very end of the path, The wintery Cabin, now fully immersed in night is where you will find **The Master of True Ghosts, Principal of Curses,  The Blezzangionan, Archfey of Terror.** The Blezzangionan specializes in things we take into ourselves that cause fear. Not the weak soul-sucking fear of the shadowfell, but the terror that drives us to survive. They say that true ghosts are not the shells of once living beings, but the energy and effort they leave behind, particularly when they leave behind a will to destroy, to avenge, to harrow and frighten. True ghosts do not have hit points because they're a part of the person experiencing them. Thus too is the Blezzangionan the master of curses, spells one must carry around with them
		Here is an example list of curses and ghosts that the Blezzangionan  might inflict on someone
		* A song you can't get out of your head, and never truly leaves
		* A sample of someone's thoughts, so you are always aware of what their perspective on the matter would have been
		* A sample of your own perspective of yourself if viewed from your past
		* Flashbacks and reminders of things like guilt or failure
		* A prophecy 
		* Geas
		* Contagion
		* The insistent memory of a loved one who is dead
		* Guilt, pure and horrifying

	
	The Ruler of the Court of Terror is a fantastically precise individual. I shall have to describe them when other threats are dealt with. 
	


	The Mizzuraer, Archfey of collection and reaping, Harvest, and picking things before they are ready to die
