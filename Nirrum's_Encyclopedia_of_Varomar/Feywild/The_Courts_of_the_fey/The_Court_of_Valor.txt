====== The Court of Valor ======
Created Thursday 06 August 2020


==== The Spiral Academy ====
	The spiral academy is a Large conical drill-shaped tower which can only ever be found near the dawnpoint. There is only one entrance to the tower which is at its base. Outside there is a sign which shifts language to read 
	**"This tower is a test of resolve. The Price for failure is likely death, and the chance of failure is extremely high. Do not bring the weak in with you. Do not bring that which cannot decide for itself with you. Do not bring in the things you are not willing to risk. Bring only yourself and your courage" **
	
	A series of baskets on a shelf wait outside  the entrance with their own sign saying "no promises" on each one.
	
	**If you have players that played** **this dungeon before, ask them now to not spoil it and let others "experience it on their own merit"**
	 Following the spiral groove on the outside of the tower, the interior is an array of rooms all filled with challenges, but they are not ordinary challenges. The Challenges presented below and are in order.
		* A stone that is 30ft on all sides blocks the first door. Touching the stone does nothing, it is not an illusion. There are no gaps around the stone, and attempting to teleport behind the stone makes the teleport fail and the person teleporting take 6 bludgeoning Damage (often, they will develop a fist shaped bruise on their face for a week or so or until they recieve magical healing). As soon as someone tries to move the stone, it rolls aside effortlessly, crashing onto its side as though it weighed hundreds of tonnes. People caught under it as it rolls find that they can hold it off of them but not change its course. 
		* A rough wall with only small handholds and a very tiny light indicating the top, several hundred feet away. Attempting to fly or teleport will only get you thrown back down by some magical force. No matter what height you are thrown from, you will only take 6 bludgeoning damage (and possibly develop a hand shaped bruise on the centre of your chest, as above). Attempting to climb the wall is an automatic success, the wall is lightly sticky and  gravity seems less powerful while climbing
		* A raging river crosses the next room, it is too wide to see the other side. Stepping into the river  without preparation forces a person to make a dc 25 Dexterity save to not be swept away at a rate of 60ft/round. Attempting to fly out of the river will result in getting hit with a wave. Attempting  to freeze the river will result in the ice being washed away at the same speed. Any attempt to swim after being washed away succeeds. 
		* An open flat room with no obstruction other than a closed (and currently fake) metal door on the other end greets any group travelling together after the river. As soon as the group is within the room, the floor falls out and they drop 1000ft, over five rounds taking 20d6 damage if they reach the bottom. Any attempt at all with one's own abilities (cleric spells included)  to save their own life causes people to disappear ( their attempt succeeds as they find themselves on the floor that just dropped out below them, prone, though **do not describe this until everyone gets it or hits the ground)**. Any attempt to  save someone else fails as magical winds rip people apart and tear spells apart but if the person who attempted to save another survives the fall, they gain a secret fey favour (**From the rigid baron) ** and one inspiration die (**From the Scion of fire). **If someone fails this challenge, they must start the tower from the beginning (if they survive), to everyone else, the door opens revealing the shape of another door in white paint on the wall behind it, which can be opened to reveal the path.
		* The next floor has wide room with a firey cauldron with a 5ft radius in the middle with 10 torches around the room (or 2x the number of party members). At the end of each turn, one torch goes out in a counterclockwise order. The torches do not need fuel and can be lit endlessly. In the center of the cauldron is a dial that rotates to point toward the torch that is about to go out. The dial spins slowly and can be rotated backwards. If it is rotated past a torch that has gone out, that torch relights. The fire in the bowl in the middle deals damage once every round (initative 20 if needed) equal to the number of torches gone out +1  but it does not spread beyond the bowl.  The pathway to the next room reveals itself once all the torches have gone out. 
		* The next hallway is a long spiralling corridor filled with octarine, red, and blue fire. The fire ignores all immunities but not resistances and deals 1d10 damage per turn to any creature standing in the hallway. It is real fire and will burn nonmagical objects that are not somehow protected, including spellbooks, most forms of clothing, and wands. items that are made out of wood and somewhat thick will be singed. **The fire cannot kill or knock anyone unconscious**. The hallway is inclined upward and goes on for 280ft. 
		* In the next room, there is a large, serrated spike pointing upward in the middle of a series of shallow grooves in the floor. An obelisk stands among the channels, where, written once in every scribable language except Infernal, Primordial, Celestial, and Druidic, is the phrase "Only willing death upon the spike can open the door. Lies or Enchantment will hurt those who make them." A Player may  offer to give their life, either by jumping on the spike. A soul-trapping spell is placed on the spike and is easily identifiable with Identify or a DC 15 Arcana check. No spells like clone or reincarnation will work against death by this spike. Once a player impales themselves and dies, the door to the next room opens
			* Groups of players who decide collectively that a death isn't worth it and walk back out of the room will find themselves in the room after the one containing  **The Gau-Magmes **upon exiting the room
			* Players who willingly throw themselves on the spike appear as they were before the spike in the room after  chamber containing **the Gau-Magmes**  after everyone has left this room. **To all intents and purposes until then, they are dead** (so get a hold of their character sheet before it gets destroyed if that's something you do. Say you have something special if you need to do multiple)
			* If a character is under the influence of any spell or is charmed, frightened, or in any way coerced or tricked into giving up their life, then once they attempt to place themselves on the spike, the source of the magic or coercion takes 5d10 Psychic damage, regardless of their location and if the magic is equivalent to or under magic of the 5th level, it is permanently undone. If it is not magical, then the deception or malice is revealed. The Spike will not accept that character unless they choose to volunteer anyway.
		* The next room is merely a window  that shows a party going through the Pitfall in the fourth room. If anyone tries to warn them about the trap or how to solve it, they are teleported to the bottom of the tower and have to repeat the entire dungeon, not counting the death spike room. If the character redoes the tower, no other parties are visible until they reach this viewing room again, where a different party is doing the same thing. If a person warns a party a second time, the cycle repeats, If a person does this a third time, the door in front of them opens and they do not get teleported but they are under the effects of the spell slow for the entirety of the next room. Individuals who do not attempt to warn the parties going through the pitfall room can simply open the door to the next room
		* The next room is a wide and round arena-like room with benches filled with angry and yelling fey. A Thin and frail archfey **The Gau-Magmes, the archfey of merit **sits in a chair above the next door. He points to the members of the party that did not sacrifice himself and calls them cowards.
			* People who warned others three times in the previous room are granted pardon and not allowed to partake in bargain for the guilty
			* People who fought to volunteer to die on the spike are granted pardon and not allowed to partake in bargain for the guilty
			* Those who were passive in letting others suffer or die for them during the tower are called out, even if they mourned.
				* "Why did you not offer yourself instead, you muck-fouling piece of shit?"
					* If they do not have an unselfish goal, they are declared guilty
					* If they were cowardly or willing to let others die instead of them they are declared guilty
					* If they have an unselfish goal, they are given the same offer the guilty parties get but are able to leave without being cursed.
					* They are told that by the powers of **The Gau-Magmes Magistration, they have two choices. They may choose to die in their friend's stead. If they do, their friend is revived, granted the skills and abilities of the person who offers to sacrifice themselves for the revivification. If multiple people are guilty, then they can all choose to make the sacrifice with the ensurance that their quests will be taken up immediately by replacements with better chances of succeeding alongside their friend, who will only only remember their journey with their new friends.**
						* By fey magic they will be granted the titles of the person who dies for them, all rights to rule, and custody of all children born and unborn, as if it was always their right. In the event of an unborn child, a surrogate chosen from among the archfey will bear them until birth and grant them a fey blessing. 
						* Any obstacle that stops a person from offering themselves to die is removed by promise of fey magic
						* People who refuse the bargain are told they are allowed to live, but are Permanently under the effect of the spell Bane, which can only be removed by divine atonement or the use of the //wish //spell. 
					* Those who attempt to attack the court and declare them murderers or declaring injustice are told they could have easily left the room and spared their life. There is no Reward at the end of this tower that should justifies the greed that killed their compatriot who was clearly willing to die for them. Fey attacked in this room appear gaseous and invulnerable to harm. Creatures with truesight will spot them as illusions with the exception of the **Gau-Magmes. **People who were simply caught off guard and did not have time to act or influence the decision of their friend are offered the ability to leave without penalty, but are not allowed to progress further in the tower if they do so.
					* The Gau Magmes is immune to any spell, attack or ability by anyone who is declared guilty
			* The Next room is a banquet that works like heroes feast, Adventurers are allowed to rest here in peace before they continue. People who sacrificed themselves on the spikes are all revived in this room. A fey attendant will reveal that all promises of the **Gau-magmes **other than the curse for those who were guilty were **fuckin lies.**
			* The next room is divided in half,  both on the floor and on the ceiling with a small round section in the middle (as well as on the ceiling) upon which is a pedastel with a lever. Once the door is closed the lever can be pulled, and the party hears the words "one side is safe" as the roof on both halves begin to close, descending one foot per round for five rounds from their height of 10 ft ceilings. At the end of the five rounds, the middle section with the lever rises instantly to meet its counterpart in the ceiling, dealing 20d10 damage to anything still standing in the middle. Both of the other sides return to normal  and a staircase emerges leading upward from the wall on the side opposite of the entrance. 
			* The second last room lies at the end of a 100 foot staircase that circles around the last part of the tower. There is a veil of blackness covering the entrance and nothing can be heard on the other side, nor can characters telepathically communicate through it. Upon entering, an individual is greeted with a completely empty domed room that is featureless and grey like graphite. A small toy puzzle sits in the middle of the room. It cannot leave the room, and solving it does nothing. No configuration of the puzzle does anything. Leaving the room after entering it brings you to the final room, with the **Scion of fire**
			* The last room is the hall of the **Scion of fire, who stands in a glassy pentagramal room that is 120ft tall, and slightly pink with the fire from their head, as well as the nebulae, stars, and galactic formations that seem to float gently by them. The Scion of fire Offers congradulations to those who learned all lessons of the academy:**
				* Stagnation is decay, 
				* the balance between loss and stability is still a loss
				* When all options look the same, try anything
				* When you are faced with impossible decisions, choose anything and know that it is your choice
				* Do the impossible, break the unbreakable
			* The scion of fire is capable of making **Oathbows, as well as staves of the Archmagi, Nine-lives stealers, Rods of lordly might, and other legendary items suited to those who succeed in their challenges, though they will only make one per person. **When people are done talking to the Scion of fire, they are returned to the entrance.

	**The Scion of fire (ENFP) Archfey of determination, (Fighter, Champion 15)**
		This radiant purple humanoid creature embodies the power of determination
			Height: 5'10 on average. Their height adjusts to how impressed they are with someone, taller for more.
			Influence: Any check rolled with bardic inspiration or an inspiration die after having failed the same roll previously. 
		Five Skulls, joined in a ring at their cheekbones, coated in a light purple flame. Hovering in front of them is a ring of red glass, with one triangular spike extending upward along the center of each skull, and two other triangles that cover each eye extending ourward until they join up with the same pattern on the adjacent skulls. The Lower jaws are all pointed, such that when they are all open, there is no gap in the center.  Thick black metallic bands seem to serve as skin for the neck, upper back, shoulders and arms. For the chest and abdomen of this humanoid creature, A toned and atheletic torso, coated in pinkish-purple transparent skin, revealing the muscles beneath. **The Scion of fire**  wears a ragged set of white pants, undereath which are no genitals, a fact which is only relevant because their pants frequently get destroyed in battle. The rest of their skin is a deeper purple metal. They do not care what you are here for, just that you are here, they do not care what your goal is, just that you have one. They are proud of you for having made it this far. The Scion of fire represents the drive to overcome, the power of determination, the ability to share, and the courage to do all of those things in spite of fear. They Freely give Inspiration die to anyone who visits them.  The scion is immune to damage and all conditions except grappled but cannot do lethal damage to any creature. They invite people to freely test their resolve against their own. To our knowledge, it is not possible to best the scion of fire in this contest, because he feeds on that willpower. For those that endeavour to inspire others to pursue their own goals, the scion of fire grants The boon of Foritude, increasing their maximum HP by 40. For those that challenge him in combat and perform admirably, they earn the boon of the fire soul, granting them immunity to fire damage and the ability to cast burning hands at will (dc 15) without consuming spell slots or needing components. Those who cast other spells that deal fire damage that get the boon of fire can now, without using an action, change the damage of their fire spells to lightning. All spells of theirs that deal fire damage now ignore resistance to fire as the fire burns significantly hotter and a colour of their choice.

	**The Gau-Magmes (INTJ) Archfey of merit and criticism (Fey magic sorcrer 14)**
		This shrivelled, Cruel, and leathery elven Judge is a champion of insults as well as a competent liar
			Height: 7ft
			Influence: 19 Acrobatics (charisma) to maintain your spirit against his onslaught of accusations
		The Gau Magmes is a merciless judge, but also quite cunning and usually well humoured outside of his role. He is gaunt, and only about a foot wide at the chest. His eyes are glowing white orbs among his severely wrinkled dark tan face. and he wears a long blue and green set of robes. He does not have feet but instead walks on two closed fists with cracked skin  from where they have been walking. He casts from a cobra stafff if he needs to. His voice is bitter and surprisingly smooth. His intonation is filled with stocatto on his consonants, and he smells of cinnamon and sulfur.

==== Sliplung nape ====
	On the back of a tower, in one of the spires of the grandia crossroads, accessible only by perilous ledge. One may find the home of a sheared ram who walks upright, and has human arms, not unlike a satyr




==== The glass labyrinth ====
	Home to **The Sandman**, **Archfey of sleep, **The Glass Labyrinth surfs through the solid dunes on the afternoon side of the feywild, for that is the only time he is in residence. Nightways, The Sandman is of course, drawing children to sleep. The Glass Labyrinth is a tower in the shape of an hourglass on the back of a massive toad. To get inside, one simply has to stand in front of the toad as it will eat anything that moves in front of it. From the Toad's mouth and up a corridor of silver that winds up from its tongue, a traveller will find themselves within the folding corridors of the hourglass, Sand whisps around their feet constantly. The glass labyrinth has only  one path, despite its name, though it does have some offshoot rooms. A loom for **The Gwairin, Archfey of Dreams,  **and a writing den for **The Geeligurn, Archfey of Nightmares. **All three Archfey within the glass labyrinth are in near constant contact with other archfey, as sleep is a gateway for many fey to work their magic. At the top of the hourglass, following the sand is where one finds the sandman. Displeasing any one of them can procure their ire, but each is also capable of working incredible magic for a price. **The Sandman Embodies rest, and indeed, their power is very close to the powers of death. **He will procure favour for one of three things, Eyes of Sapient beings that are still living, Sand from the bed of the River styx, or the name and location of any creature that does not sleep. In exchange, he can bottle sand so fine that it flows like liquid. A creature that pours this sand on their eyes gains the effects of a **Long rest, **and the sand dissipates, though he can only produce one such bottle a day. Alternatively, He can procure a potion of sleep so powerful, that the creature that consumes it, is placed under the effects of Sequester, though they are visible and otherwise indestructible. The condition for their waking must be achievable by a single person and will be told to people throughout the ages in their dreams, but it remains an effective prison. Abberations, Constructs, Feinds, Celestials, and Undead are immune to these effects, as are Frogs, Toads, Bullywugs, Grungs, and other similar creatures.
	**The Gwairin **grants favour easily. They will ask you for an obtuse metaphor every few seconds for an idea they mention every second for 8 hours ("Something for peace?" "Trees", "Something for poor conditions at work?" "Digging a tunnel that collapses") And in exchange, they can either tell you the meaning of any dream you have ever had in plain and clear terms no matter how magical, cast the spell dream with automatic success on a creature( provided they can sleep), or they can work a dreamcurse such that a creatures dreams will always end the same way until one of two conditions is set, one you of your choice and one of theirs (subconsciously). 
	**The Geeligurn** is a far more complex creature. She is haglike, and delights in tormenting creatures. She has great sway with the college of terror. She writes the nightmares for any given night on sheets of black paper, which she sends off to be dreamt
	
 

==== The Wronghouse with the big toybox ====
	Thousands of wronghouses dot the feywild, Sometimes in towns, sometimes alone. In one of them, a squat cottage sitting on the very edge of sundown where a thin sliver of light still marks the sky, one may find a massive toybox. Those who enter this wronghouse will not only note the usual bizzare geometry (along with being much, much bigger on the inside than the outside would suggest) but also that they themselves are usually vastly aged down, such that they are infants again. Interestingly, Constructs and other beings who have never been children will find themselves still shrunken, buzzing with energy, and vastly more curious, even if they have never been such. This home is the home of the Delasalia, a great weaver of short fantasies, and a personal favourite of mine.  Characters will find it easy to remember how to play as a child does while within this house, largely because it turns out it is much easier to imagine things like you used to when you're suddenly a meter tall again, but partly because of the magic of the Delasalia. There are a surprising number of children in this wronghouse, many of them having brought toys of their own, and many of them missing from their homes for an extremely long time. The Delasalia does not kidnap children, but she finds it hard to remind them that they need to go home. The Delasalia stocks many toys from many cultures to accompany children as they wander through the wronghouse, climbing through windows into tunnels that deposit them in kitchens. At least one of the kitchens has a troll in it, who seems to be friendly but often threatens to eat the children. Children who are told this frequently scramble to the myriad tiny doors and cupboards, which invariably lead to escapes, such as hallways, small towns of toys underneath gargantuan beds, the tops of shelves, and the spaces underneath stairs. Central to this house's magic is the Big Toybox, which is a rather large crate of toys. Someone digging through the toys will invariably find a toy that jogs any memory of play. Figurines of old friends, stuffed animals that look very similar to pets that folk once had. Such toys are free for taking, but they return to the toy box if they are ever destroyed or if they get rained on, though getting wet in other ways is fine, including rain through a covering.

	**Delasalia, the archfey of small imaginings, (INFP),** Archfey 
		This playful elflike lady can control what age she appears and plays many roles. 
			Height: 5'4
			Influence:  Athletics (Wisdom) 10 to be responsible, even when it means leaving some things behind.
			Favour: 1960
		The only thing that sets her apart from the other, usually human, manarahi, or orc children in the wronghouse is her sparkling purple hair, Extra finger on each hand and extra toe on each foot, and that her backmost teeth sparkle prismatically. The Delasalia is secretly quite potent, as she controls the seeds of many intrusive thoughts. She favours thoughts of budding architecture, companionship, and ideas that are distinctly more pleasing than the truth. Such thoughts are the gateways to many powerful spells, and the Delasalia is the keeper of many of these gateways. She offers favour to anyone who finds a way to induce more small imaginings into her and her playmates, whether that is through an interesting toy or statue, a prop, or by becoming a playful antagonist to the other children there. She will also offer favour to anyone who completes a quest of bringing a toy to someone who once visited the house but left. That person, when they recieve the toy, has the option to return to the house. If a person dies in the house, their soul becomes part of the toybox, to bring joy and to play with the Delasalia and her friends forever. In Exchange for favour, the Delasalia can grant a person a special door handle that can be placed anywhere that leads into one of the corridoorways in the underfey that connects to the wronghouse at some point. Alternatively, she can create a special doorknob that, when touched to any door, will disappear and link that doorway to a location of the holder's choice anywhere on any plane of existence that the holder has already been. Once this is done, that doorway will forever link to that same place, and only passing through the door in one direction will bring you to the new place, passing the other way has no effect and the door functions as normal. If the doorway is taken apart, the effect ends, and if the doorway would lead to the home of a god or being capable of 11th level magic, it may not work, provided the being has taken steps to prevent it.
	

==== Halls of Agony ====
	Shallow in the Underfey, somewhere usually duskward, are tunnels through dark woods that peel secrets from those who enter. The stonewoods in which the halls of agony wind are particularly thick and nearly indestructible. The air here is always cold, below freezing, and this is because of **The Maiden of Winter, Archfey of Grief, **who makes her home down here. This is the spiritual home of all Winter Eladrin, and the quickest and most direct route into the shadowfell. Creatures who venture into this realm are faced with the things they have tried to hide from themselves. These insecurities manifest with a common theme. You are the source of your own pain. Characters will find themselves separated in here and undergo the trial of agony unless they have done so before. 

		Preparing **The Trial of Agony**
	**Dm's Note: **This //must// be prepared ahead of time and done carefully. No bullshit, and be very careful of giving back powers like wildshape, prestidigitation, catapult, and the EK's bound weapon. The more carefully you prepare this, the better it will go. Prepare poorly, and your players will spot your bullshit way of dooming them to fail and they'll give up. **Do your best to make it seem possible "if only". **
			* Each character loses all class abilities, all innate spellcasting, their natural weapons crumble and fail, their luck runs out, their armour and gear vanish. The only things that do not vanish are charms, boons, curses  and cursed items
			* Each character finds themselves separated from any party they were with and no power nor ability is able to allow them to regain contact. The trial is best done in solo sessions
			* Each character is told that they have what they need
			* They are presented with a challenge to regain their most used tool, weapon, or spell, which they inevitably win, though wounded, usually through spells like magic missile cast within the challenge
			* Each of the following challenges has a simple premise: Win the challenge and get a Ring of Wishes, fully loaded. Fail the challenge and suffer
				* The challenges are all rigged to cause failure, **each one something that would succeed if they had one of their lost pieces, each seeming very possible**, and each time, the character gains an injury from the Injuries table (dmg 272) though the injury is accompanied by perpetually stinging magical ice which repels magical healing.
				* Upon failure, the character regains one of their lost aspects, and is told to continue, there is no backing out, no escape. 
				* This repeats five times (or until all aspects of the character are restored). There are no rests, no recoveries, no time to gain advantages. Expended items are expended permanently. 
				* on the sixth time, they have everything they had previously, but retain all of their injuries. They face the tarrasque, mounted by Elder Dramuut, wielding a gargantuan sword of answering. The character is alone
				* upon their inevitable and quick death, **The Maiden of Winter appears to the person and asks them how they felt and informs them that they did worse than their comrades did, **
					* If they are attached to a member of the party emotionally say "Most of them, at least"
				* They are told they face one more challenge, and the ending is far more permanent, and they are given an option. Pass into the shadowfell to escape, or to face their challenge, knowing that success is going to be just as hard as it was in the previous challenges. 
					* Those that escape to the shadowfell leave the campaign entirely, their characters may be recovered but that's an adventure on its own
					* Those that choose to take on the next challenge are left in infinite darkness until all members of the party are done with their challenges
				* Each character, individually is eventually asked a question from a voice in the dark. "Will you bear your scars?"
					* A character that says yes is granted the following benefits
						* For each eye lost, they gain blindsight of 30ft
						* If they lost their left hand, they gain an additional reaction that they can use once per long rest
						* If they lost their right hand, they gain an additional bonus action that they can use once per long rest
						* If they lost their left foot, they can move twice their move speed when they take the dash action
						* If they lost their right foot, they cannot be knocked prone against their will, even if unconscious or dead
						* For each limp gained, they gain 5ft of movement speed on foot
						* For each internal injury, they permanently add 5 to their hit point maximum
						* For each broken rib, they gain an additional hit dice (for use in HP recovery on rests and other abilities)
						* For each Horrible scar, they increase their charisma by 1 and their charisma maximum by 1
						* For each festering wound, they regenerate 2 hit points at the start of their turn while alive (but not necessarily conscious) 
						* For each minor scar, that character may choose a harmless sensory effect that they permanently express, such as the smell of cinnamon, Hair that blows perpetually in its own magical gentle wind, or a shadow that moves in a different way than they do.
						* **All missing parts are then replaced by replicas made of snow, stone, water, that function identically to the originals. All damaged but intact parts are perpetually cold and often frosty but provide no other detriment. **A character may choose to disguise these replacements as normal parts, but they lose the benefits while disguised. Horrible scars can be revealed to gain the benefit to intimidation and detriment to persuasion as a bonus action, fey illusion peeling away to reveal frostbite in the area. 
					* A character that says no is restored to normal with no benefits (but secretly, their next child, if they have one, will be a siofra)
				* When the trial is over, they are allowed passage through the halls of agony, and any time they return to the halls, they regain any lost body parts, save those replaced in the trial of agony. They are also allowed Audience with **The Maiden of Winter **at her leisure.


	**The Maiden of Winter, Archfey of Grief (ENFJ) **
		This black haired elf is made entirely of snow, ice, stone and water.
			Height: 10ft
			Influence: Persuasion (intelligence) 30, to recount your greatest loss to her
		For a while, the Maiden of Winter was the ruler of the court of Valor, but in a moment of hubris coupled with several dashes of betrayal, she lost herself entirely, all her goals shattered, her soul sucked out into the shadowfell. She feels she can recover herself somehow but isn't sure of what to do. She grants favour for true tales of grief, and redeems favour in the form of the charm of Nine lives. 
		Those who bear the mark of the raven queen are granted the boon of luck, free of favour. 



==== Clariontop ====
	The tallest mountain on at least one side of the feywild is an old crystal fireheart. Its sides have been chipped and dented from age, making it far more opaque than a fresh fireheart. Clariontop is the site of many a pilgrimage for bards in the feywild, as the archfey that sits at its peak is the Archfey of Performance, **The Caroller.** Clariontop is a rough climb, and while there are routes up the mountain, it poses its own challenges. 
		**The base**
			The base of the mountain is covered in a smooth sheet of water fed by streams that flatten when they reach the facets of the roots of the mountain. The sound makes the mountain seem to hum gently. Where imperfections in the mountain's surface cause ripples, drips,  shallow currents and bubbles, one can hear symphonies and complex music from many cultures and styles. Here, herds of Sweetwater Forzetas drink the water, which is, as the name implies, strangely sweet. The Forzetas are extremely territorial.
		**The Slopes**
			At a certain height, the water converges back into streams, which have gouged the side of the mountain, though not especially deep, Here, well above the surrounding treeline, the wind whips violently, and spirits try to make travellers fall down the mountain to their doom. In fact the winds are Malevolent and envious of those who may get the opportunity to talk to the Caroller, and will do their best to Push travellers to their deaths
		**The Clouds**

		**The top**
			Pushing past the clouds, and well into the sky of the feywild, such that the skies darken slightly even in the full light of day, The polished crystaline  peak of the fireheart suddenly flattens. There at the top is a multi-tiered circle of Trilithons made of blue shale sitting in the middle of a wide ringed garden.  Fourteen rings, divided into eight even sections each, showing a gradient of everblooming flowers all converge on the central circle of megaliths. While this plateau is nearly a mile and a half wide, the pillars in the middle only take up a space of 100ft across. There, in a mossy field, is **The Caroller**. Who sits in a hammock above a spring in the centre of the fireheart, which radiates in a single channel. The hammock is suspended from the smallest, inner ring of megaliths, and has a small tarp over it, though no significant wind blows nor does rain seem to fall up here. A single everburning fire lights the rings with warm light, and a sheet of shimmering silk portrays images of the caroller's choosing, particularly of powerful divinations. There is *always* freshly boiled water for tea, and there is always tea and infusions to be had. The garden hosts plants whose flowers and leaves are all aromatic. Lavender, Rose, Linden, basil, rosemary, marigold, and one species of goldenrod that smells strangely of malt vinegar are among over a hundred plants in the garden. 
			
		**The  Caroller, Archfey of Performance and song (INFJ)**
			Once a human wizard, the Caroller is now a fey, shaped by magic beyond the ken of many great mages. Their understanding encompasses more than most
				Height: 7ft
				Favour: 4000
			The Caroller appears androgynous, and is anatomically intersex, and delights in people trying to work out if they should be attracted or not. The Caroller dresses in a open-front and airy blue silk wizard robe, adorned with golden stars. Under this coat, they wear a loose brown shirt and canvas pants. Their feet are hooves cloven in three, with the middle piece of the arc being thinner and slightly pointy. The pupils of their green eyes are ringed in brown and are Long W shaped slits. Their mouth is often drawn in a smile and their ears are pointed, not unlike an elf's. They wear a wizard's wide brimmed hat, also blue and decorated with stars, with a small bell dangling from the peak. Often leaning up against their hammock is their staff, a relic from their days as a mortal. The Caroller is uncommonly powerful, and does not trade favour frequently. She is fully capable of retreiving people's names in exchange for favour, and is quite sympathetic to people lost in the feywild without an understanding of its nuances. He is capable of spells up to the eleventh level and knows a great many secrets for wizards, warlocks, and bards, but it is bards that her particular interest lies. In exchange for a song, composed of at least ten consecutive checks of DC 20, he will grant the composer knowledge of any one spell of their choice from any list, whether they can cast it or not. The caster can choose at the end of a long rest to burn all of their spell slots for that day to cast that spell once, instead of needing the spell slot for it. The spell cast this way requires no material or somatic components, but will always have verbal components that are a few bars of the song that earned it. She speaks manar more fluently than sylvan, and he tells his origins are an unremarkable tale of a wizard from Mana ulla, who plummed the depths of the magic of a song until they became part of it. 
			


==== Puddlestorm Forest ====
	In the sundown lands, where the light is weak, an ancient and wide puddletop forest causes perpetual rain. When magic is thick, the rain may paint the trees dark teal, but rain has been falling here for a long, long time. Here is the residence of the **Harlannenna, Archfey of the Rains. **She is subtly powerful in that she both keeps this patch of puddletops alive and is would be its death. She is the archfey of precipitation, and her dance is valued by a great many fey, In particular the Liavalri, Lord of the Morning and Archfey of Crisp scents. She is a powerful designer and engineer, and considers each raincloud's destiny under her guidance. From Sunshowers to Monsoons. 
	
		**The Harlannenna, Archfey of Rains (INTP), **
			A lady who seems to be made of falling blue colours, continually cascading over her. 
				Height: 9ft
				Influence: 89 Performance (Dexterity) to Even come close to matching her dances.
			The Harlannenna usually appears as a humanoid female, made of painted rain and brimming with magic. She is quiet, considerate, but also not one to entertain guests. She prefers to remain alone and, while friendly, tends to avoid meeting new people. She repays favour with specialty rain. A crowd favourite is thick, cool drops after a muggy day, falling straight down. **The Harlannenna ** is not bound to water, and can cause particles of anything to fall on an area, though this is often an apocalyptic event for those places. The Harlannenna does not want for much, and will give favour for waterproofed books, particularly highly imaginative fiction, especially science fiction. 
				//Nirrum's note: Technically, she's the Archfey of what we do when it is raining, but that's a mouthful and harder to explain//
				
				
				




==== The Centre of Magic ====

	Set in the midnight point of the Feydark, is the dancing ground that is the centre of magic. Here, Fae of all kinds come to dance, but on each change of the seasons (a rare event in the feywild) The greatest dancers pull the magic of the far realm through the warden of lightning and weave it into new magic. At this time, magic flows evenly, as perfectly as the dance, which allows for all sorts of carefully timed rituals. The Grounds are  cared for by **"The Mapmaker" **A rather tall Siofra. 
		
		**The Mapmaker, Guardian of the Dancing Ground**
			So many people tried to control him because of the conditions of his birth, now only he can decide his path
				Height: 6'7
				Influence: None, as a questionably Mortal NPC
				Favour: Varies
			The mapmaker wears no clothes to give breath to the cerulean markings on his skin to glow in the night and sparkle in the light of sun and moon. He was raised outside of the feywild and still has ties there. As Siofra, he can deal in both favour and more conventional means of trade. He never breaks a promise but is careful when he makes them.  He accepts wine and beer as gifts, but is not bound to reciprocate. Still, he chooses to do so, and as all mortals, can act without recieving gifts without endangering his life. If he knows someone's quest is to safeguard or protect a child, he will help, and he has a fondness for helping addicts out of their addictions. If needed, he can learn what paths have been tread in an area and roughly when they were made. He can find people through  nearly any obscuring magic. He is incapable of reading any script but is intelligent otherwise. He has interesting and powerful abilities though they are in line with others of his kind. He has excellent senses, and is capable of ignoring them at will, stripping away various stimuli until he finds the ones he needs in isolation. He is capable of teleporting at will to any place of significant similarity to the one he is in, an ability he has honed to get anywhere very quickly. Finally, he doesn't take fall damage and is capable of casting plant growth at will, but only for the longer duration version.
			
			
			
			
			

==== ~~Valley of the Questor~~ ====

	~~Occupying the vast expanse between two sets of starcrags, thrust into the deeper parts of the night, is a forest valley with trees that seem entirely content to be permanently on fire. They have been that way for a long time. Where the ragged rock ceases, blue grass surrounds the squat yew trees that dot the long depression, giving ample light by which to navigate the valley. The valley itself is home to an Archfey known as **the questor**~~
	



==== Kalu DaLadu Rei-oh, Castle of Valor ====
	
	Holding a stark contrast to the surrounding landscape of a particularly Orange elephant sargasso sea that bleeds into a very wide storygrass grassland, Kalu Daladu Rei-oh is a deep blue complex of walls, seemingly of Sodalite. A tower sits in the centre of what is essentially a maze, continually rotating. A long scythe-like blade extends out of the tower and sweeps along the top of the 15ft high walls of the maze, hugging the tops of the walls so closely that they are covered in dismembered birds' feet. The feet only seem mildly concerned with this as on occasion, they find their way back to the bird they came from in a series of hops, though some are content where they are. The Scythe goes over the top of the maze twice a minute (and this is one of the few times time has any meaning in the feywild) Flying around the top of the maze is an ancient red dragon, whose eyes have been replaced with sapphires, whose hands are coated in thick tar, and whose fire is vibrant pink with green flecks. The red dragon is clearly in agony and attacks anything that isn't a bird that flies in the airspace above the castle grounds. 
	
	To enter the city one must cross the moat bridge and pass the gate guard who is a fairy wearing a horse chestnut shell as a helmet, a hazelnut shell a shield and wielding a porcupine quill as a spear. He wears a shirt of chain armour but because of his size, there's only about sixteen links on him, and his arms stick out through the holes. He always stops and asks "who goes there" to anyone who passes through, though he will never stop them. He will attack immediately if anyone touches the gate, but since the gate is always open, it is rare. He will stop attacking if people promise to not touch the gate, as he guards it. No one must steal the gate, it is very valuable.

	Truthfully, the castle of valour is as much a city as it is a challenge. There is only one entrance, but living inside the walls behind incredibly small doors, in drainage culverts, and in behind the cracks in staircases, are fully furnished fey homes, often those filled with Harengon, the odd Aulufeydth orc, elves, humans, and other medium-sized creatures. Those who try to enter doorways too small for them will find themselves shrinking to fit, those who crawl through culverts and under bridges will find lavishly adorned open-concept abodes wherever they can fit (which is more places than they rightly should). There is, of course, a Xanarans fit into A particularly thick wall near the entrance to the left, marked by a very very skinny dark stained wooden door with the word "Xanaran's" chalked vertically along the front. The barstomun within wears glittery eyeshadow, a tiara, a pair of wrought iron butterfly wings on hinges that poke through his Black and pink vest and shirt. His pants and boots are the same ones he always wears and he expresses distaste of what he has to do to blend in to all non-fey that enter.  Most fey are unaware of Barstomun's disguise, those that are find it //hilarious, // and can usually be spotted dying of laughter for their entire stay in the establishment.
	
	Kalu DaLadu Rei-oh is still a challenge to navigate. To do so one must successfully navigate the small maze, which is thankfully static, though it is filled with Powerful Valour fey.
	
		**The Wallwarden, Archfey of Impedence  (INFP,) Paladin (ancients 15)**
			A giant and completely encased suit of armour lumbers through hallways while singing of flowers
				Height: 11'
				Influence: A song about flowers Nature (charisma) dc15
				Favour: 2250
			The Wallwarden is a mountain of a creature, wielding a bizzare longsword, whose pommel is spiked, whose guard is an axe on one side and a pick on the other, and whose blade has a disc guard in the middle.  The wallwarden halfswords his sword, claims it is useful against armour, and that it is better for such a tight space. The wallwarden does not move aside for anyone, nor can he allow anyone to pass him. One must go a different direction to get further into the maze. For favour, the wallwarden will grant a permanent bonus to AC equal to a creature's strength modifier, or grant them fey guards to guard any location for the duration of their lives (which is often quite long). The wallwarden give favour for one ton of quarried stone, a quarter ton of cut  stone bricks, one sodalite block like the ones used in the castle already, or for a full bottle of //The ultimate lubricant. //Within his armour, the wallwarden is a huge green-skinned and thick froglike being, with no semblance of neck, and with amber eyes mounted in a small dome of a head. He smells of solvent and his footsteps fall with unhealthily heavy thuds. 

		**The Skililuma, archfey of crescendos and rising action, (ENTJ) Druid, (moon 16)**
			A  sour tempered patron who must be avoided unless something is urgent
				Height: 6'
				Influence: Urgency worth half of your hit die for the day
				Favour: 2560
			An orange coat festoons this lanky elf-like creature. She has tined horns and a narrow face in which long, tilted almond shaped eyes stare judgingly. Her cloven hooves clatter on the ground as she walks and her pale lionlike tail peaks between her coattails. Skililuma has no time for anyone because there is always something urgent happening, but it can be assured that she will increase the tension of anything she is involved in. The Whispers fey often redeem favour with her just because of her talent at making outcomes less clear. She wields a staff with a ram's head which functions as a ring of the ram. At her side is a shillelagh of deep purple. She will take suspenseful books of fiction which she intends to read in her spare time in exchange for a favour. There is a veritable library somewhere of these books, entirely untouched. She will redeem favour in the form of a blessing, wherein twice between long rests as a bonus action on your turn, you may re-roll your initiative for the next round (you cannot go twice in the same round with this ability).
		
		The **Erlking Shymbalaeo, Archfey of Growth, Lord of the court of Valor (INTP)**
			A Teacher of Knights, Paladins, Writers, and Public speakers hidden in a hideous body that charms in its own way
				Hieght: 4'6, very hunched
				Influence:  To see true power and beauty within, Perception(Constitution)
				Favour: 7840
			The barest hint of hair falls from a lumpy and misshapen head and along a hunched back. Pallid, veiny skin stretches over bumps and indentations. Half hidden by an overgrowth of bone on one side and a deep socket for the other, are two fiercely clear brown eyes. A mouth of few teeth still delivers a voice of liquid gold. The Erlking moves with awkward grace, a painful gait of his barely functional skeleton that seems to allow him to flow from place to place like silk. While he cannot look up directly, he can do so from the side, which gives a person he must talk to in such a way the impression that he is about to share in a masterful plan. The Erlking is, by all visual metrics, Ugly. His hands barely seem to function and at least one shoulder does not. Despite this, he smells of clean spring air, and is unquestionably well spoken. He is intensely friendly and has a powerful sense of when people wish to be spoken to, and is wont to oblige. He is a powerful patron, and he is not the lord of the court of valor for nothing. The Shymbalaeo replaced the previous archfey of valour in a long age past. When a succession war broke out, he simply walked to the throne, sat on it and said "whomever can take my beauty from me, shall hereafter be Lord of the court of Valour." He has gone unchallenged since. The Shymbalaeo does not give out his true name, but allows folk to refer to him as the **Erlking, **For in his first moments as a lord, he captured the heart of the Verdant Queen, matron of dryads, and married her. Her work keeps her out away from civilization so he often sends people along to meet her with gifts, usually mead and bread. The Shymbalaeo grants favour for the defeat of villains, those who crave power they already have, or for the knowledge of one's deepest insecurities. He is unlikely to tell anyone about them. In Exchange for favour, he grants a person the ability to regenerate 1d6 hit points once per round as long as they are conscious, as well as immunity to disease. He gives this favour frequently, as he often takes the name of those who are weak of heart, leaving them unable to accomplish anything, and drawing their power unto himself.
