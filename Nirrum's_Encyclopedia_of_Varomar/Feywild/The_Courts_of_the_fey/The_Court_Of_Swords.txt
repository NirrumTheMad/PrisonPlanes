====== The Court Of Swords ======
Created Sunday 23 August 2020

Along the shores of one of the fey oceans, often ducking in and out of it, are the most common places to find the facilities of the court of swords. Seasons pass exceptionally quickly in the Sword lands, though time often seems to stand completely still

==== The Temple Spa of the Rigid Baron ====
	Carved into the steep slope of of a short mountain range  covered in rigid coniferous trees  that flower in bright Lilly-like flowers  when magic is cast nearby is a orange-and-grey temple that from which rises many plumes of steam. The mountains face a bay in the late afternoon fey. The crescent mouthed bay hold grey waters that are around 17 celcius. The wind that blows up the mountain is cool and bracing. The temple is composed of many parts. The main hall, where a statue of the rigid baron overlooks wrestlers, acrobats, and on occasion, some other, rather masochistic practices, such as fey sitting in sconces. Behind the main hall are hot springs, fed by the boiling falls, and cold falls, fed by the freezing spring. Here, any injury can be healed. With the permission of the Rigid Baron, Any being can have their shape remade within the scope of their power.  For fey, this requires favour, for non-fey, this requires hard work maintaining the temple equal in experience to half of the mortal's life so far, Thankfully, where this is the feywild, that doesn't take long.  There are many stone meditation platforms where folk can go to become inspired, to reflect, or to exercise. **The Rigid Baron** is the keeper of the temple spa and its abbot and head trainer, as well as **The archfey of biomechanical structure. **
	
		**THE RIGID BARON (ENFP) Swords, Archfey (Fighter,  unarmed fighting Samurai 12)**
			Height: Equal to the height of the person they last spoke to
			Influence: 19 Athletics (constitution) withstand a mighty fistbump with the core of your soul
			Favour: 2560
		THE RIGID BARON is a Muscular humanoid of masculine figure, firm hands, and skin that is golden if he is viewed from the back, Blue if he is viewed from the front, ruby red if viewed from the right and bright purple if viewed from the left. He is green if viewed from above and sunrise pink if viewed from below.  His face is the face of an axolotl but with a Large sweeping moustache. He wears only a black and gold kilt and leather sandals. THE RIGID BARON  likes to test the resolve of people who ask for his help by challenging them to a wrestling match. The outcome of the match is irrelevant to the baron though, simply that they showed their resolve by fighting well. The Rigid baron uses their favours to force people to use their strength, physical or mental. The rigid baron has a gargantuan greatsword that he can summon and weild without penalty as a bonus action, but only does so in the most dire of situations
		

==== The Hall of Moments ====
	In a seaside cave on the edge of a harsh ocean an octagonal tower stands.It has three floors but seems to grow more as you approach it and usually less as you move away. The Tower's walls are Red with pink and metallic green streaks. The Doors are a set of curtains that are very heavy but will flutter under the lightest breath. Inside the tower Is a series of rooms that show people singular moments or allow them breif, ephemeral experiences. Upon entering the tower, one finds that there is onyl one floor with one corridor that branches into 3 after 1/3d it's length. The circular windows never seem to show the same outside, but other areas of the feywild (which one can travel through, should one leave through the window. The windows can be entered through but it is considered rude). Each room holds a powerful enchantment built by the fey working within. Once you enter, you experience the moment, and then it slowly fades. Love, fear, Agony, Ambedo, Loss, jubilation, thrill, Dysphoria, Sonder, Occhiolism,. Each enchantment's form comes with an illusion, what you see when it grabs you. On occasion, Manaharahi Therapists will visit this tower with their patients to help them face trauma or to experience something they usually don't. You cannot be physically forced into any room in the hall, The doors will not open if you don't want them to when you grasp the handle. The Illusion that comes with each enchantment is unique to the person experiencing it. The Hall of moments is tended to and overseen by **The Gogg (or Gogue)**, who is also the archfey of hearts (metaphorically. To our knowledge, none of the archfey hold any extra power over actual viscera, save one). A water channel runs through this tower, and it is said to either feed into or derive from the river styx, following the flow has been an exercise in futility though, as it often disappears underneath roots or falls around corners that are not intuitive to navigate. **The Gogg** grants favour for one dreamless night, in which the gogg raids one's memories for the most potent feelings a person has ever felt and their context, causing a level of exhaustion the next day. For favours, **The Gogg** is willing to teach the spells "plant growth" and "spike growth" to any class that does not use wisdom as their casting modifier. To warlocks, **The Gogg** is willing to teach eldritch blast, which takes the form of long vines with curved knives for leaves. For anyone else, **The Gogg** can make slippers (or other footwear) of spider climb that also cause one's hair to smell of citrus when cut.
	
		**The Gogg (ESFJ) Swords **Archfey, (Fey Magic Sorcerer 10)
			This strange pinkish Orange Flower grows rapidly  when it needs to speak  and withers to a crawling rhizome when it does not
				Height: max 5ft
				Influence: 4 History (charisma) Recall a moving moment that will impress this creature, it does not need to be from your own life
				Favour: 1440
			The Gogg is a moving flowerbed  that simply grows //in// the direction it's headed and withers in the direction it's coming from. The Gogg his violently opposed to people not experiencing things and will constantly try to enchant or illude people who are avoiding facing their own emotions. The Gogg is notoriously nosy and petty, moreso than one would expect. The gogg is easily swayed however, appeals to emotion nearly always work on it, even if they are ludicrious propositions. Despite this, they will use their full power to prevent people from damaging the hall, and we've not been able to quantify what it takes to stop them. It is suspected the hall itself has some sort of life or power. The Gogg  can grow a seedpod as a bonus action that at the start of the next turn drops a dancing rapier. 
			

	

==== The Corori Cloud Formation ====
	Sitting in the center of one of the fey oceans is a fog bank. should one attempt, they will find that they are able to //walk on this cloud. //The gentle slope  continues upward for what feels like a few minutes but looking backward shows the journey to be impossibly long. At this point the cloud takes on the shape of a thunderhead made out of trees, with their massive canopy eclipsing hundreds of impossible thin trunks, through which sunlight  streams through. Thunder can be heard through the trees but it always seems to be far off. The smell of ozone and seabreeze without the taint of wrack is omnipresent and the breeze is soft and cool, but not cold. Parties will find themselves Constantly bombarded by sensation, They'll notice rocks in their shoes, they'll notice their hair as it touches their head,  and their clothes as they shift and move as they walk. Characters who succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw will begin to notice fey around them, invisbile to others. The humming of wings, the patter of feet, occasionally a white and pink face with abormally large eyes disappearing behind a tree with a giggle.  Characters who notice this are assaulted from all angles by various weapons. The weapons all roll with a +1 to hit once per round. If one of them hits a character that has noticed them, they are reduced to 1hp and are able to gain Audience with **The Sel'Evi. **The Archfey of mental tranquility and awareness is a compassionate creature and grants those that are able to visit him a permanent +10 to their passive perception. **The Sel'evi **is also capable of granting other senses in exchange for favour. He is also willing to grant favour to a creature that performs an action that snaps a creature out of a state of illusion or madness swiftly, Such as a well-timed punch to someone who is panicking. For such a deed, the **Sel'evi **is willing to grant truesight that works so long as the eye is not exposed to sunlight, Tremorsense that works so long as the feet are touching the ground  but fades if they ever touch linen or wool, or darkvision that works until one is frightened, each out to the extent of a person's normal range of sight (24km on a clear day). If someone gets **three natural 20 rolls in a row** and one of these rolls is a perception check, the **Sel'Evi**, bolstered with the power, can make this ability permanent upon visiting them afterward A character does not need to have the ability upon returning, just to have had it previously.


	**Sel'evi DISTRACTION AND ENLIGHTENMENT**
		This cloud-coloured figure is hard to reach but easy to talk to.
			Height: over 8000ft
			Influence: Investigation (wisdom) 18 to force yourself to act without thinking on the illusions that misguide you
			Influence: 3610
	The Sel'Evi is hard to describe, by their cloudlike nature, both in metaphor and truth. They are the archfey of living in the moment and are extremely adept at forcing people to recognize that moment. They are truthfully one of the primrary gates to the So-called "Shadowlight", the positive harmonic of the shadowfell,  where the deadening, self-feeding emotions don't bring dread and destruction. The Sel'evi is more powerful than people give them credit for. The Sel'evi does not move from their position frequently, as they would take the entire corori cloud formation with them, and the difference between the two is useless to attempt to pinpoint. 


==== Exquisite Terraces ====
	Where one of the stageroads meets a seaside bluff somewhere along the sunset side of the crepuscular line, there is a set of stagest without setting reaching out over a cliff edge. Their polished yellow wood marred only by a few gouges in the wood that heal slowly. Lit by lanterns that burn with white fire which spills out around the edges of the casing. The white fire's light barely reaches off of the stages, where piles of bones and corpses are stacked high. The eyes of these fallen seem to follow the people that walk the stageroad.  At the end of the road where it becomes a wooden cliff, stands **Garsusanla, the Archfey of wounds. **They are one of the rare fey that uses their actual name instead of a title. Garsusanla can offer aid in combat to anyone who is able to deal large amounts of damage to him. **Garsusanla's **name is harder to use than other fey names. In terms of power it is ponderous and gargantuan. **Garsusanla** knows this, and is able to use their name freely because no one can really take it, and anyone who can will inevitably make him more powerful. **Garsusanla **is aware of the conditions that it takes to destroy any creature, and is effectively capable of seeing ability scores, saving throws, initiative, and HP, among other details.

**Garsusanla Archfey of wounds (ISTP) **high elf, (Torrents barbarian 14, war wizard 2) 
	A dark maned elf with tawny skin and split hands that bleeds and wounds for sustenance 
		Height: 5'7
		Influence: Medicine (dexterity) 19 to throw sand, sugar, sap, honey, or alcohol in the most greivous wounds
		Favour: 2560
	Garsusanla bleeds from many long gashes all along their body. In their  hands which are cut in half between the middle and ring finger to the wrist, they weild a Pala (1d8 slashing) and a Kpinga (handaxe), the latter of which is often thrown.  Garsusanla is incompassionate, rough, and cares nothing for the plight of other people. To gain anything from him, one will have to bleed.

==== The Eclipse ====
	Quickly moving along the dayside of the feywild is a rapid ribbon tiger, a gargantuan but relatively thin cat, similar to just a tiger skin. On its back are the fey who follow **The Saithek, Archfey of Focus.** As the tiger moves around the fey landscape, creatures have  very little time, less than a round, to gain some form of purchase  on the tiger and to hold on. Climbing up on its back introduces you to a series of fey who represent some of their best warriors, and on occasion, their best scholars. They are exceptional at getting things done, and **The Saithek** is focused specifically on getting things to focus, to maintain their attention on the task at hand. The Saithek is capable of breaking many curses, but requires some form of dedication before they will even act. Fighting, speaking with, or working on something that engages the mind fully shows your devotion to the idea of focus, of removing distraction. This Empowers the Saithek which they take as favour. The Saithek grants favour rarely, only to those who remove one of the obstacles that the tiger will face, such as a river, mountain, or diplomats. The Ribbon tiger is simply intent on running under the eclipse, and these fey of the court of swords on its back are of no concern. 
	
	**The Saithek, Archfey of Focus (ISFJ) Human variant (slasher)(Fighter 20, Samurai)**
		A glassy human with no face, whose dark shirt whips in the wind and whose sword strikes quickly
			Height: 6'
			Influence: Intelligence (Any) 30 to remove all distractions from your mind and peel away those things that hinder you from a task
			Favour:4000
		The Saithek wields a **Good Sword**, always in two hands. He wears a dark shirt  that is partially unlaced revealing a glassy chest. The Saithek  goes first in any combat, and unleashes  nine attacks, seven of them with advantage. Surviving this onslaught is never a guarantee, but those who do have a unique opportunity. Fighting the Saithek can grant one a permanent bonus to their initiative equal to twice their proficiency modifier, but there are rules to follow. 
			1) No talking in the combat without an explicit effect in the combat
			2) No Failed concentration checks
			3) No distractions. Getting caught offguard by something getting damaged, a teammate falling, or any sort of emotional reaction other than determination 
		If you manage to succeed in damaging the Saithek and surviving two rounds under these conditions, you are granted the boon. Fighters, Monks, and Rangers are granted the opportunity to study, and if they stay until the tiger next crosses the noonpoint (an indeterminate amount of time) they are granted the ability to use Steel Wind Strike once without components or consuming a spell slot, recharging after a long rest. Others who display such focus add double their proficiency bonus to concentration checks. 
		Even encoutering the Saithek can remove many curses and obstructions, as the Saithek has no time for people talking to them while they are distracted. 
		
	The other fey on the back of the ribbon tiger are often focused on their own studies.
	//Nirrum's note: And in order to remove a curse placed upon me, I am going to list some of them//
	
	**That which boils wine, (ESFP) Sprite (Rogue 7, Investigator)**
		A typical sprite who plays a pan flute, but has a fierce look in their eye
			height:  9''
			Influence:  Charisma (Persuasion 12) to convince them you are correct
			Favour: 490
		That which boils wine, whose true name is not hard to find, is a dedicated rat-killer, and intent on never missing another rat in their traps. To my knowledge, there are no rats in the feywild, but they have a calling and they will follow it.
		
	**Ukondo (ISTP)  Summer Eladrin **
		A fool who has won precisely half of their battles, and takes the name of anyone they win against
			Height: 5'6
			Influence: none, as a mortal NPC
		Ukondo was the name of a misbegotten elf who last fought Ukondo, only to lose their name and die shortly after without it. The one who is now called ukondo constantly seeks to become a better warrior, but gets cocky after each win and wagers their name. When they inevitably lose, they try far harder and fight life and death to gain the name of the next creature they fight. Their goal is to find the bastard who has their original name.

	**Elsaulia (INTJ) Archfey**
		An amorphous yellow creature that takes many startling shapes quickly
			Height: varies wildly
			Influence: 300 dexterity (sleight of hand) to fool their eyes.
			Favour: 360
		This creature revealed themselves as a boast. They are immensely sure of themselves and no fey, mortal, or eldritch horror has yet been able to break their gaze. They once stared down an eye carved in a rock until the rock weathered to nothingness. Their gaze can pierce any obfuscation and they never break eye contact. In the eyes of the horrors of the universe, they are a very very sharp rock, and one they will avoid touching. Overall their power is extremely focused
		
	**The Gambuuni, (INTP) Fomorian**
		Wielding a massive sword (6d6), this giant rends trees that grow too close to the tiger's path
			Height: 17'
			Influence: 23 Athletics (Wisdom)  to join them in their treefelling
			Favour: 640
		Proof that will can be power in the feywild, This Fomorian is neither particularly evil nor particularly strong, but regardless, with their sheer focus, they are able to cut clean through massive trees that grow in front of the tiger. They grant favour to anyone who is able to cut down 12 trees with them, requiring at least 18 damage per strike. They can, seemingly, make any weapon resize to huge, tripling its damage die, but making it progressively more unwieldable to smaller creatures. 
	
	**Tal'morko (ISTJ) **Drow (College of Whispers bard 13)
		A Sneaky and sly elf who disguises themself as the person looking at them
			Height: 5'6
			Influence: 16 Investigation to see through their illusion, though they do get salty after
		A smug and cocky elf from some plane where they do not know the name Manaharamu. Training with **The Saithek** to get an edge on their targets and disguising as a fey to pass under the radar of travellers. They will likely attack anyone who sees through their illusion, and they are a formidable opponent, but a prepared party can simply undo their machinations. The Saithek wishes to keep them alive but wants to ensure they learn a lesson about keeping their composure. They are dressed in purple silk and use a Jambiya (dagger) coated in drow sleep poison.

==== Dragonwild Garden ====
	In the midmorning regions of they feywild, in a muggy dragonleaf forest not far from a coast is the Dragonwild Garden. Here, several Lore and Swords Fey work to procure many rare ingredients from fey and magical plants. They are overseen by **The Rosfunss, Archfey of quick wit, insults, and comebacks. **This is an excellent place to get ingredients for 
	
		Goodness you look terrible, I'm glad we didn't pull a changeling on you. You look like uncooked dough. 
		

==== Bo'om-Neskir, Castle of Swords ====
	On what used to be an island, in the centre what used to be a crater from a massive meteorite, is a building of epic proportions. To each person it will appear different. A pen, a sword, a hammer, a harp with thunderous sound and a slow shockwave, and rarely a giant smiling and biting mouth set into the fabric of the atmosphere as if the sky were skin, all in mid motion. The Object will always fit the theme of a tool that person must use to make decisions and changes against everything they do not know, Dividing fact from fiction, Illusion from reality, left from right, silence from speech. A path leads down the wall of the crater, across the basin, and up the impact cone of the island. Every step makes the object move slightly. Each person that travels the path will realize at some point that the motion of this object will impact **Them** specifically. The end of the trail is invariably scattered with remains of beings who encountered an impact from the object that person sees. The object only moves as the person does, and will rewind its course if they begin to move away from it, no matter the direction. Normal contact with the object is instant death, and this is the defense of the Castle of Swords. However, the castle is not without an entry. Meeting force with force, A challenge with challenge. When I , Nirrum the Mad, visited the Castle I heard these words in an impossibly final voice
		"**I offer this challenge. The door is closed"**
	and I cast a spell to unravel how to open the door... and the door opened. All "challenges" are of a similar nature. Parry the sword, Harmonize with the harp, Bring paper to the pen. In the face of this impossible structure, accept that you don't know everything and act on what you do know as if this challenge was something you did every day. The secret to the **Razor Gate** is that it is simply **The Gillesiinnika,** Gatewarden of the castle, minding a cast of **Gatewarding. **The illusion of the object coming to contact is dispelled and it is revealed that the object is, in fact, **significantly larger than first imagined, such that it takes up most of the view and never seems to get closer.** The path continues in this direction toward the business end of the object. Behind the Gillesiinika are two walls of white topped with brass finials. Climbing over these walls causes one to leave the castle, as will flying up more than a mile. The castle consists of a small maze of open-topped rooms spreading from a central corridor, functioning as a fortress. Within are the amenities to perform nearly any task, but no help to do those tasks. Using the castles' amenities is a privilege afforded to all visitors, but only those invited to use them can do so without owing favour.
	
	At the end of the Alabaster and steel main corridor is a large pedastel, upon which sits **The Geencheyna, Lord of Division, Edges, and Decisions, Ruler of the court of Swords.**
	The **Geenchena** looks like a
	
	
	**The Geencheyna, Archfey of Swords (ENTJ) (fighter 20 Battlemaster)**
		This murky green Lord does not speak with words, but with swords
			Hieght: Matches opponent
			Favour: 4000
			Influence: Beating any DC by precisely 1 in his presence, it must be a real challenge and not artificial to gain influence.
		The Geencheyna appears as an old Gith. Murky Green wrinkled skin, deep sunken yellow eyes, and a suit of dark green armour, that is well articulated but lacks obvious holes or vulnerabilities. He rarely speaks and can intuit much of what sort of person they are facing from melee combat. This tells them not what a person may want, but what sort of person they are and to either consent to help them or not. In nonhostile combat with the Geencheyna, No attack rolls are made. Instead, Players may //Choose what damage they deal with a strike//. Higher numbers mean higher conviction, while lower numbers mean uncertainty and weakness. Higher total numbers may mean overconfidence, and lower numbers may express need more clearly. Medium ranged numbers may convey grim determination or indicate something obvious. In turn, the Geencheyna matches strikes, with higher numbers expressing dismissive doubt, Anger, and opposition, while lower numbers indicate consideration, invitation, playfulness. Numbers in the middle of the range are not neutral but more dismissive than higher numbers, such a response conveys irrelevance. In this combat, maneuvers and attempts, powers, and shenanigans are all allowed, and are interpreted as your approach and methodology to solving problems. As well, they convey your intent, and thus, another battlemaster will communicate the most efficienctly with the Geencheyna.  It is customary to greet the Geencheyna with your strongest attacks, but one may withhold such an attempt in order to hold their energy for the discussion. The geeyncheyna matches a player's weapon, provided it is a melee weapon, as he chooses to ignore any other method of communication. Players may help eachother and heal eachother in the discussion, but the Geencheyna gets angry if he gets ganged up on. It  is not polite. People who are rude or Hostile to the Geencheyna  face the full power of the lord of the court of swords. The geencheyna becomes 8 perfectly co-ordinated level 20 fighters armed with Longswords of the Grandmaster. Often combat will go until one of the parties is knocked unconscious, but this simply means that the normal rules for resting and healing apply, and even the Geencheyna sometimes needs to take a day to heal. The Geencheyna will redeem favour with granting a person Proficiency with any single weapon or item of any size or quality in their posession  with complete disregard to any restrictions. Magic that would control the person through this item becomes magic in their control, as if they were the source. Space and magic will warp to accomodate the use of the item, though gargantuan swords will remain difficult to use in doors and forests as an example. The Geencheyna will give favour in exchange for a mortal apprentice of suitable quality. Often, this Apprentice will become the one to be the judge of the player's actions and choices. The Geencheyna has many warlocks and a few Siofra.
