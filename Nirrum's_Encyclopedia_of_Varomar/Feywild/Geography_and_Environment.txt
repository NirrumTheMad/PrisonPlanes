===== Geographic regions and biomes =====
Without attempting to describe their relationships to eachother, the feywild has the following notable regions, sometimes multiple. Most biomes on the prime material also exist in the feywild, but here are some notable new additions

==== The Dragonleaf Rainforests ====
	It turns out that dragonleaf trees flourish in the feywild, preferring the crepuscular regions mostly. Along several levels of one of these crepuscular regions is the dragonleaf rainforest which seems to be made *exclusively* of young dragonleaf trees. Depending on the position of the dawnpoint and duskpoint, they remain there constantly. When the dawnpoint gets to directly overhead, they start their flowering cycle, where they get extremely aggressive. Ones that succeed then leave the dragonleaf rainforest for other parts of the feywild... probably. They definitely leave for somewhere. Within one of these forests, closer to the dayside than the nightside, is the infinite river, which connects to the prime material plane somewhere south of Manaharamu

==== The Puddletops ====
	Along the afternoon and ealy night bands of the feywild, there is a region known as "the puddletops". The puddletops are a series of pools of water which seem to defy gravity, at least for a bit. Water flows from groundwater aquifers and up along aquacles shaped not unlike tree trunks and into a canopy  of... just floating water.  These pools seldom connect but on occasion they do, and in a few places small rivers can be found flowing uphill. The further upstream one goes, the thicker the trees become. These trees, known as Skypools, house many fish, as well as a relative of the darkmantle that drops down from them, as well as fey Hydra anenomes, which lie in wait with dangling tentacles to pull up things that wander into them.  four legged skimmers run across the tops of these skypools looking for organisms to feed on with their sharp proboscis, but occasionally descend underneath the skypools for safety. The largest skypool is often described as "The size of ten dragons". It is suspected that there is a connection to the local elemental plane of water at the top. 
		* Puddleskimmer
		* Hydra Anenome
		* Splashmantle
	

==== Bouldergarden ====
	The rocks in bouldergarden show every sign of being alive, autotrophic and growing though the growth is extremely slow, even in feywild time. That said, the boulders can be found to grow. What trees grow in this region often have boulders *overgrowing* them. Many of the larger ones have fossilized fey who decided to try to make a home inside one, only to find one day that they couldn't get out. Many of the trees that grow in bouldergardens are usually mundane, though they're often particularly fast growing trees, such as maples. Stonepeckers like to use the boulders for getting food, by methodically carving out large portions of rock, leaving them tenuously attached, and then severing them when a creature passes underneath. 
		* Stonepecker

==== Mirrorlakes ====
	Dotted around the feywild are mirror lakes, which behave like normal lakes but with some odd features. They are always perfectly reflective, but splashes and drips sound like and behave like broken glass, slowly melting back into the main body after being separated and returning to a smooth surface.  Real aquatic creatures cannot breathe under the surface, but they are not uninhabitted, as the reflections in the pond take a life of their own, and often an adventurer has been spooked after taking a drink and watching their reflection walk off looking unconvinced before they get a chance to do the same. Some lakes seem to allow more than one of the same reflection, others do not. Mirrorlakes are usually peaceful regions, and one can indeed drink the water in a mirrorlake, though it feels as though one is chewing on tin, and one's urine will look like quicksilver for a day or so. Most creatures despise this feeling though at least one adventurer reports that they have come to enjoy it.

==== Wronghouses ====
	Not unlike the bouldergardens except they grow buildings, often ones that can be found in the real world. However, the features of these grown buildings are frequently flawed and sometimes two might combine. A room might not have a door or the door may be too small and way too high off the ground, A window may look into a wall, a rail may be across a hallway. these are signficantly more safe to be in but getting lost  is still easy, this is the feywild after all

		* Culdersnatch

==== Storygrass Grasslands ====
	When the wind blows in the wide plains that have storygrass, you can hear whispers, songs, and occasionally stories old and new. The grass is semi-sapient and can communicate but usually isn't spectacularly helpful. 
		Some helpful story ideas
		* Romeo and Juliet but mercutio comes back as a revenant and roasts everyone for the rest of the play
		* Any Sherlock holmes story but the villain is a fey named "the Gomnos", a recurring character in any such stories.
		* any of the Prewritten fairy tales among the courts

==== Elephant Sargasso sea ====
	In A few areas in the feywild there are vast oceans of grasses standing over 10 ft tall. The grass is sharp and can cut if you're not wearing clothes but has trouble going through clothing or scales. While the area is navigable on foot, fey eels swim through the grass looking for prey. Other pseudo aquatic life forms live here including Screeching crabs, spritefish (which are like sea horses), and Chaff barnicles. Interestingly also Lucky Tigers (with lucky) and of course, Normal elephants
		* Fey Eels
		* Spritefish
		* Screeching Crab
		* Chaff barnacle cluster
		* Lucky tiger

==== Solid Dunes ====
	Areas of vast desert that are made of solid sandstone. The sandstone still moves in a way that imitates a dune, individual grains swim up through the dune to the lead edge and cement themselves in. A traveller at the leading face might find it begin to grow over their body rather quickly, trapping them and suffocating them unless they can hold their breath until the dune passes, though, most of the dunes are too big for that. The Face of the dunes only move about 5ft per round at their fastest, and only when the wind is high
		* Roller Scorpion
	

==== Rotoscapes ====
	A rotoscape is one of the stranger instances of fey environemtal changes. A landscape underneath the effects of the rotoscape appear to be drawn and redrawn into existence. Lines are grainy and  constrast is high as if done in charcoal or graphite, everything is represented fairly minimally. Eyes on a person may only appear as dots

==== Drayevarg ====
	Occasionally one will find a graveyard in the feywild. Within these places there are an abundance of angel statues which  will never move while you look at them or even rarely move while you're there but can in fact move and often reorganize the place. Things age backwards here, things are born out of the graves and plants age backwards. So do people but it takes a long time. When you enter the Drayevarg, its backward like nature becomes immediately apparent to you, as you will have technically already experienced it
		1) you have to walk backwards in order to proceed though the graveyard
		2) you must learn the few instructions after you leave the graveyard or you will have never been able to get out, and you will find yourself back inside of it.
		3) getting stuck in the graveyard for too long will slowly take away your memory
	Everyone who gets stuck there de-ages but when they de-age fully, the angels set up a new grave, eventually something gets born out of the grave but we're not certain what relation it is to the thing that the grave belongs to. The statues only make new graves on the outside of the Drayevarg, which is how it moves

==== Bladefens ====
	Battle is an important part of the feywild, in places that touch the material plane, the blades of the most passionate warriors might find themselves missing. They usually end up in the feywild in bladefens, catered to by Fey of the Valor and Sword courts. Blades are placed with their hilts in the ground, grasped by buds of red-tipped blue asters that only bloom if the weapon is pulled from the ground.  The fields are guarded each by a member of the courts of Valour and Swords, one to protect the stories of the swords, the other to protect the passion of the warrior that feeds the asters. When someone approaches the  bladefield, they'll be asked to either a duel by one of the fey. The duel can be any form of duel and the fey will attempt to match so long as it is "in the time of  a duel," or at least has minimal prep time. Interestingly the fey *always* lose these duels, at which time the other fey begins a composition to honor them and the winner of the duel is allowed to pick from the bladefen, after which the remaining fey will use a spell to pick all remaining weapons. The unchosen weapons magically disappear and the bladefen blooms fully in bright vibrant blues speckled with iridescent red. The fey that lost the duel invariably dies of their wounds, even if it was a game of cards, chess, or in one recorded instance, a spitting contest. The bladefen can never be visited again by mortals, or at least, no one has found the same one twice.
	
	

==== Halberd Pine Forest ====
	Halberd pines are a broad category of Coniferrous (heh) trees that have a habit of having their tips be various polearms, all modestly strong steel, True Halberd pines being the most impressive. The wood is surprisingly dense and strong. The cones of the halberd pine are full of fragrant oil, which feed Tellar Sheep and Mara Beetles. The Mara beetles in turn get preyed on by Holdoron's Weasels which are gargantuan. Halberd pine forests are always the territory of a singular Lonely Barrier Roc, whose droppings are what provide nutrients to the forest. The aulufeydth often get their weapons Grown fresh from these forests, and take them home to work-harden them into proper blades. When the Roc takes off, the heads of the trees have a tendency to fall.  Unfortunate creatures caught in these storms have to be careful to not get hewn in two!
		* Tellar Sheep
		* Mara Beetle
		* Holodron's Weasel

==== Songgroves ====
	A songgrove is a colony of plants that bear the sounds of instruments. They all play in harmony but they only play in harmony with what they can hear, travelling through a songgrove is a journey through a theme of music. Travellers must take care, for conductor birds compete to harmonize the forest with their song and will attack anything that disrupts that harmony. 
		* Conductor Birds
	

==== Stage Roads ====
	The concept of a road is metaphorical, but in these sunset parts of the sunset fey that metaphor becomes reality. Spotlight shines constantly on travellers making hiding impossible. The area around stage roads //look// like stages, with risers lifting up out of the ground and showing various forms of pannelled wood, tiled marble, or draping curtains. Each stage has a unique scene on it, with trees growing out of the stage in appropriate ways. While on a stage road, everyone is capable of casting the thaumaturgy cantrip as a bonus action, though the fires never seem to spread.
	

==== Unveiling Woods ====
	A thin wood, dotted with wetlands and puddles perhaps is a charitable description of the mild horror that comes with an unveiling wood
	
	Bare-branched trees draped in semi-transparent veils if white. If a thing with flesh walks behind it, it looks like a skeleton to those in front of it. The veils function like Xrays, basically. I'd bet there's some large invertibrate predators there, who take advantage of being basically invisible if behind a veil.
	
	If something is posessed or acting against their will, the thing that is controlling them is shown instead. If the creature is concealed with an illusion, the illusion is stripped away and their true skeleton is shown instead.
		* Bobbity worm

==== Painted Rainforest ====
	In the afternoonwise feywild, some valleys become host to great rainforests. Occasionally these rainforests produce enough rain with enough speed that magic gets swept up with it. The resulting semi-permanent deluge creates a painted rainforest. Each drop that falls has its own colour, and anything it lands on will change colour to match. Depending on the conditions, these forests can be nigh unnavigable with colour noise, or the colour may fade from one tree to the next. To survive, nearly all creatures in the forest are reflective, chief among these creatures is the Shining Jaguar, which has an incredibly powerful bite.
		* Shining Jaguar

==== Iridescent Woods ====
	Light shines, things at certain angles reflect only one colour.
	
	Iridescent woods are a shimmery but dangerous place. Under the noon sun, things that live in these regions have the peculiar property of being iridescent, but with a strange conformity. Any object at the same angle as another gives the same colour of light. While this is not a perfect model, things trend more violet from red as they move from vertical to horizontal. This effect isn't universal, things that don't live in the woods do not display these properties while within them, though water that flows through the area seems to pick it up rather quickly. Many creatures make use of this effect for camouflage 
		* Grassy Chameleon

==== Tiny Techtonic valley ====
	These places are long, predominantly flat valleys filled with dried cracked mud. These pieces of caked mud shift and move and crash together like shifting landmasses, where they meet, tiny volcanoes form and the ground jiggles with miniature earthquakes. Fires caused by these volcanoes remain proportionately sized and a wayward adventurer may take minutes to notice the conflagration if it has gotten onto their clothes.  It is wise to douse onesself in one of the five ponds at the end of the valley upon exiting to prevent this, or if you're travelling the other way, the large one at the end. Strangely these valleys appear to be shaped like a gargantuan humanoid foot, miles long. Of course, crossing this arguably vast desert is not without its dangers, as Miniscule giants, dragons, and worse all still defend their territory. Particularly dangerous are the rocs, which are the size of an average chickadee, and actually capable of some form of harm.
	

==== Serpent's Caves ====
	Throughout many regions around the feywild, tunnels bored deep into the rocks and hills migh become serpent's caves. In the darkest parts of these caves, glowing blue ribbons hang from the ceiling above blue pools of water. These blue ribbons are  cyclomorphic, and grow slowly until they touch the pool of water. There they become an axolotl-like creature with six eyes and green or brown stripes and spots along a blue body.  Here they feed on bugs and occasionally pixies until the pool dries up. When the pools dry up, all of the cyclomorphic axolotls become normal mundane snakes that scatter through the fewild, occasionally ending up on other planes. If a creature ever gets bitten by ones of these snakes, they'll find themselves frequently ill and compelled to travel in the direction of the nearest portal to the feywild, and from there, they are compelled to find a cave, usually the cave the snake had originally come from. There, the person experiences violent vomitting. Part of their vomit will be a light blue ooze that crawls out of their vomit and up the wall  where it cements itself and begins slowly growing a new ribbon. If a ribbon touches the ground without  touching the water, it will transform directly into a snake. If an ooze is removed before it reaches a snake cave, it will attempt to find the nearest suitable cave and begin a new cycle there. To date, no one has devised a method by which to tell which snakes are cyclomorphic and which ones are entirely mundane
	

==== Starfly fields ====
	In the deepest of the midnight plains of the feywild, were even darkvision can see nothing without *some* form of light,  one might find wide, grassy fields amongst the common woodland of the feywild. In these fields, starflies perform their beautiful dance in order to mate. When they are mature, a starfly will light up using bioluminescent glands, not unlike fireflies. The brightest starfly in the area becomes the center of attention, and other starflies will begin to orbit them in lazy ellipses and circles, trying to get their attention. This has the effect of looking like planets orbiting a star. Lesser flies may attempt to circle other flies in the system, becoming "moons" of a sort but often if two flies get too close without deciding to mate, they will fling off from eachother and disrupt their place in the system. Predatory Comet bugs may zip along a sharp ellipse around the brightest starfly, picking off the weakest but never going for the brighter ones. Because they orbit the brightest light, adventurers may find themselves the centre of attention themselves. A campfire or the light cantrip can easily gather the entire field, creating a bright starfly galaxy.  The starflies work with apparent luminosity and once they find a mate, they drop out of the system and onto the grass to lay their eggs. These regions are mostly peaceful, as Starflies are unappetising to most creatures
	

==== Firehearts ====
	Occasionally, the forces that compose the feywild combine with catacylsmic releases of energy. Usually a fireheart volcano is part of this. A solid mountain of mostly clear glass, or at least something very like glass, clear enough at least to see the warm glow of the lava at its core. There are two types of Firehearts, faceted and frosted, with Facetted ones giving off stunning light patterns and the frosted ones giving a diffuse glow. Whenever lava is thrown or flows from one of these, it will always harden into a frosted or faceted crystal, making for superior orbs for wizards. Sometmes, fey are born in firehearts, either from the crystal tephra or from the heart of the volcano itself. Fey born of the crystals might be indistinguishable from other fey save for their glassy composition. Fey born from the heart of the lava are always powerful. 



==== The Underfey ====
	There is apparently an underdark in the feywild.
		* Glass place with bubbles and glass rain, Greenish or glowing, sometimes see all the way to the surface

==== The Feydeep ====
	There is also at least one ocean in the feywild

==== Standstone outcroppings. ====
	perfectly vertical inclusions in any landscape, Standstone looks like sandstone, but it has the peculiar property of always attempting to stand on edge, like some strange gravity magnet. Huge bluffs of Standstone pierce the feywild skyline, boulders dot the landscape, and occasional, natural stacks of standstone  pop up all over. Standstone is useful for its resillience to damage and its strange ability to maintain its position. Vines that grow on these outcroppings are useful in making  slippers of spider climb

==== Spruigia Forests ====
	Spruigia Ash Trees are among the most successful trees in the feywild. They grow to enormous heights, far higher than could regularly be possible, and their branches are massive. Spruigias tend to grow through the feywild's twists and turns in very efficient ways, which might give a person the illusion that they are simply normal straight trees, but looking down off of the wide branch roads that often wind through spruigia, one can rarely see the bottom. Seemingly infinite misty voids, occasionally pierced by lancet leaves on broad boughs. Spruigia forests are home to many more aerial fey creatures, and are a choice home for Fairie dragons, and indeed, Green and Gold dragons who end up in the feywild often can be found darting through the trees. Limb Drakes also  defend spruigia branches with all of their might as territory and will mercilessly attack anyone on its branch
		* Limb Drake
	

==== Nistleburr Junctions ====
	Nistleburr is a wiry, twiggy shrub with ivy-like leaves at its flattish canopy that grows 7 ft tall at most. it is found all over the feywild, frequently blending in to the local plant growth, but sometimes standing out entirely. Nistleburr compacts the feywild between its branches and it is very easy for a large creature to fit neatly inside one, despite only appearing about two handsbreadths wide. Nistleburr often spreads through its roots, and occasionally, forms a Nistleburr Junction. When two, nearly equal height  bundles of Nistleburr grow, they form a gateway to other parts of the feywild. There are nine ways to pass through a nistleburr junction. Halfway through and out the left side is often the most catastrophic, as this leads closer to the underfey. Halfway through and out the right side leads one in the straightest, path, and one can continue on the path they already were on. If one passes through the arch and walks around the nistleburr again, either left or right, one can find a different destination still. If one walks around the nistleburr and then back through the arch, more locations can be reached. Walking through the nistleburr from the side, lining up with the other nistleburr will lead one either to the previous parent nistleburr, or to the location of the next pup of nistleburr. Walking straight between the nistleburr is the final way to approach it, and these paths are intuitive to the fey. If one turns around  to proceed back through the nistleburr, one must take care to turn //left// after exiting and walking straight. Turning //right// and heading back will lead to yet another place. 
		//Nirrum's note: What happens if you fall through the top?//
	

==== **Fairy Rings** ====
	Fungus, it turns out, is extremely adept at getting where one does not expect it to be. Wether by the will of Zuggtmoy, Sylvanus, or by its own hubris, Mushrooms tend to spread across the cracks in reality and where they do, fairy rings form. Fairy Rings are simply circles of mushrooms in both the feywild and the Prime Material. most of the time they are entirely ordinary, the product of spores spreading in a circle, but if you step in a fairy ring and the flow of time changes, either resuming to normal, slowing or speeding, then there's a good chance that the veil between worlds is thin here. Sleeping in a fairy ring, casting any teleportation magic within, or casting druidcraft within the circle can slip one through to the other side. 
	

==== Stonewoods ====
	The complex geometry of the feywild allows for the concept of forests that grow entirely underground, supporting a roof made of itself, through which no light can nor ever will shine. Untellably vast caves composed of a roof, a cieling and endless trunks of trees made of various stones. Stonewoods are useful for getting materials for magic items that are intended to contain things, such as the iron bands of billaro, or Iron Flasks, as the magic of the stonewoods rebuffs many forces. The stonewoods are home to horrors though. True Night Terrors, fey of the foulest make are found in these seemingly endless corridors. 

==== Corridoorways ====
	The same magic that makes wronghouses makes these expansive labyrinths in the underfey  where the space-altering geometry of the feywild is particularly noticeable. Corridoorways are filled with hallways and various doors, not unlike the Danzuishanese maze in execution, but with less spatial sense. Corridoorways often have special monsters that follow people through their winding pathways.

		* Wronggoblin
	

==== Wicklands ====
	Into the darkness of the evening, past the last rays of sundown, one can find wicklands. A stretch of hard paraffin wax, dotted with trees and candlegrass Predictably, the trees here are usually on fire, as they grow long wicks, self-ignite, and use it to draw wax upward feeding on it, and then spreading outward along longer, thinner fibres which become branches as they grow their own pith. These trees are particularly dense in flames around the base, where they put out sacrificial branches to keep the wax below them melted for easy transportation. This region is popular with fire elementals, which like to hide under the surface of the wax ground, melting it so that a passing creature falls in if it is heavy enough to break the wax. Lore fey also particularly love the wicklands as the wax here comes in many forms with many uses in their constructions

==== Chesslands ====
	Well into the dark of night, the ground begins to become patchy until it becomes solid squares. People Travelling through the region are in an extremely wide chessboard, and one of the only parts of the feywild where right angles make sense. Chesslands have their own specially adapted denizens
		* White and Black Socked Velociotters
		* Pawncrabs
		* Orthagonal and Mimic Royal Aggrocoral
		* Single-footed Fey shoalback
		* Horsehead Goblins
	

==== Witchriver Grove ====
	Snaking through the midnight regions are occasional rivers that run thick with an opaque golden liquid. Hags, witches, druids, and the occasional wizard frequent the feywild in search of these rivers, as the liquid is useful for potions and spells, being a mighty catalyst for illusion spells. Of course, nature abhors a vacuum, and Witcheaters prowl the shores and surrounding Groves. The trees are Mostly Lionwillows and are excellent for making wands
		* Witcheater
	

==== Weeping rivers ====
	Rivers of undrinkable salt water have made this dark land a graveyard. In the Evening portions of the Feydark, where the last vestige of sunlight barely tinges the sky with scarlet, dead trees and cracked earth are stalked by special horrors of the feywild. Powerful Fey of the court of terror, Lysamnoras, weep into bowls as part of a ritual to summon the tears of the feywild, and all the surrounding planes. When the verdant earth finally is ready to weep, it does so in torrents which quickly carve a channel in the landscape and suck out the life around. Creatures of other planes sometimes come to drink the tears, from beasts who crave salt, to demons and devils.  
		* Lysamnora
	

==== Bellfields ====
	 A series of fens and dales of small flowers made of copper and bronze that hold tiny lights within them, caged within the petals. When they tinkle in the breeze, they call out the unbound regrets that were left unfulfilled. Tiny copper-furred elephant shrews listen with their proportionately large ears to the secrets. Their eyes are pearly and shine in the light of the bells, but when they are frightened, they flip over to a matte black side. They hide from Belling Cats, which have bells where their eyes would be, to blend their movements with the tinkling of the flowers. There is a danger in the bellfields, Large anteater-esque creatures called teardelvers seek creatures that have eyes and bad memories. Their tongue charms their prey magically as it sneaks around their eyeballs and begins drinking both their tears and their remorseful memories. Creatures caught in their grasp experience both extreme pain and euphoria and are incapable of doing anything about it. The safety of the creature is not a concern to the teardelver, and it will hold on to them tightly with its massive claws. The Teardelvers are not brilliant animals and can be fooled easily by fake eyes. They're not particularly aggressive either, and will look very innocent while they slowly kill people. Never travel alone in a bellfield. 
		* Teardelver
		* Belling cat
	

==== Lightflower Hills ====
	Massive flowerbuds dot hillsides in the midnight regions where stars still shine. Each bud, as large as a small creature, contains an explosive surprise. Once ripe, they release showers of sparks and loud popping sounds and booms, but need to be disturbed to do so. When the wind blows in these regions it is an inescapable cacophany of Light and roaring thunder. Disturbing them before the wind blows however may alert predators who stalk the hills to your presence.
	

==== Starcrags ====
	Where terrain suddenly turns to sharp walls of  grey stone, the night of the feywild reveals its grandest and quietest beauty. The starlight is enough to see by for even the most sun-drenched of humans. Indeed, the Arabesque mosaic of the feywild night sky sits as an incomparable jewel. After about an hour within the starcrags, something special happens. Thin lines begin to spring from creature to creature, barely interrupting the shadows of the ground, but enough to be seen. Each person will find themselves in a constellation of their own, with the lines telling of the true nature of the relationships between travellers. However, the crags have predators, dark creatures that are truly alone, and no line can touch them. An astute traveller can track them by finding their constellation in the sky, and to watch for wandering stars, as those are the only tracks the shadowy beings have.
		* Craghaunters
	

==== Pale Expanses ====
	In the deep night, where only a very small handful of particularly recalcitrant stars still shine in otherwise unending blackness, the ground begins to cast a shadowless ecru glow, revealing only itself and  the creatures that swim under the extremely solid surface. Rather, only the flesh of the creatures that swim under the surface can be seen. Humans, elves, goblins, Aulufeydth, Whales and cetaceans of all makes, fish, birds, cats, almost everything with a skeleton seems to be represented. In the rare occasion that something swimming below dives above the surface, it leaves this shadowy idea of flesh behind, and swimming through the air as bare bones, luminous like the milky ground they erupted from. They rarely stay above the white for long, for in the black they cannot know their flesh. Those who walk these regions are the only things that walk with flesh. Be wary, for those things that swim beneath the hard ground are wont to avoid those who tread lightless in the black, and if frightened, may attack. Keep the light, and you might pass unaccosted. Those that die on the expanses are pulled apart until their bones begin to glow.
		//Nirrum's note: In the event a wanderer is already a skeleton, they can swim harmlessly across the region provided they find some way to transport their equipment across, as only bone can fall beneath. In this state, they will regain some feeling of flesh without much feeling of mortal need. Similarly, if you drop anything made of bone into the surface, there's a good chance it's lost unless you have a skeleton bring it up for you.//


==== Myceloria ====
	One of the most uncomfortably disconcerting regions of the feywild, the morning light is enough to see the calm but varied colours of this massive "forest" of mushrooms. Mycelium intertwined in beautiful braids, joining in marvelous knots are all one will find if they dig in the region, that said, one has to enter the region to realize its true nature. Outside of the forest looking in, the region seems to lack outlines and soundlessly vibrates with perpetually shifting colours, and occasionally wild visions that scarper across what can only be called a screenlike canopy, as undefined as it is. Sounds coming from within the forest can sound like literally anything, often life advice though perhaps in voices unexpected. Worse still if one is afraid of the forest, the visions become increasingly hostile, worrisome, and generally awful. Within the forest, a perpetual dusty snow coats everything. This snow is in fact mushroom spores, and once inhaled, things begin to calm down. The shapes all cease their movement and become normal giant mushrooms, some of mundane varieties, many of magical ones. These mushrooms will grow wherever they land. On hair, on skin, inside lungs, sprouts of fruiting bodies quickly cover anyone passing through the region, only to burst into spores or fall off. This seems to have no effect on creatures walking through, and those with unattended lung problems have actually reported their breathing was better. Myconids of all types seem to enjoy this reason, and many fey make quite a bit of favour by collecting the rarer mushrooms from within. The mushrooms die rather quickly while outside of the region, though some can survive if kept in ideal conditions. 

==== Lighting Praeries ====
	Afternoonwise, some regions find themselves engulfed in perpetual grey skies, as well as thick ground fog, three feet high at most, though no one reaching through them with their hands has been able to locate the ground that they themselves walk through.  Healthy and mundane trees dot the landscape in rare patches, memories of what the land once was and occasionally suggesting the location of rivers hidden under the vapours. The clouds are only half the spectacle of this wide and open land. Lightning sheep give the region its name, bundles of quadrupedal arcs of bluish white  bounce around between slower, purplish ones, coated in electricity. The smaller ones play around like the lambs they are, while the purple, older sheep seem content to graze. These creatures are mostly passive, with the exception of the rams which are fiercely territorial. They are not the only thing that lives on this plain, as darker cloud formations on the ground will sometimes devour the lambs, leaving only plaintive zapping sounds  unless a ram wards them off. It must be remarked that these things are very much still lightning and hurt immensely to touch.
		* Lightning ram
		* Cumulus Electrovore
	//Nirrum's note:  Nor has anyone who has attempted a handstand in these fields returned... I wonder if Archmage Kotsi would be willing to go//



	

==== Dimming marsh ====
	Draped in the golden light of the late afternoon one might find wide marshes filled with bright purple asters, cattails, and of course, Fey Swamp sharks. Water that ranges from ankle deep to 6 feet deep snakes between the grasses. Often boardwalks snake through these lands giving safe passage, but not always. Off the boardwalks, the songs of swamp sharks  lure birds to their deaths, and Blinking whelledon flowers offer a promise of solid gold roots... or perhaps that is just a will-o-wisp, luring travellers off toward death. Grandmallows bloom their massive five-petalled pink blossoms, arching up over Cottonfirs, Their roots can be boiled for a delicious and fluffy white sweet. There is danger in the dimming marshes aplenty. Giant Jays are more than happy to drown someone, or trip them into an Archdrosera (also known as a Clapper Sundew) and pick at whatever's been caught in the sticky trap before it gets digested. The dimming marshes get their name from the dimming mosquitos, which make the landscape seem to get darker and closer to night, often causing creatures to get tired more quickly. This is their trap, for anything that sleeps is liable to get swarmed and drained. They can be warded away with fire, wind, or cold easily enough.  Smoke is the most effective.

==== Gamnus Oak Woods ====
	A tree not disimilar from Spruigia in its immensity, Gamnus Oaks are impossibly broad trees with dense canopies, such that it is hard to tell what is ground and what is wood. A few gamnus Oaks can fill a mile of space as they absorb starlight in the young midnight regions. Fey that do not wish to be found (or eaten) often hide in these and do their best to remain hidden. The trees are populated by Giant Fey Squirrels which feed on the acorns of a mature Gamnus (which is often one place where fey are born), leaving buckler-sized acorn caps lying around.  Hunting these giant squirrels are Dracoons, which can't fly but can glide, and whose breath weapon is Identifiable by the colour of their nose.

==== **Highmeads** ====
	noonwise, rolling fields sometimes find themselves at the foot of a mountain, or occasionally, they become the mountain. Highmeads are among the highest peaks in the feywild, next to firehearts, though they always look like grassy hills, just... ones that go up too far. They have gentle slopes, and if one travels into the winter, there is nothing better for sliding. Sometimes, they even breach the clouds, and at their summit, one can feel the warmth of the sun as flowing magic.

==== Manglowves ====
	Planted firmly at the edge of night, just after the last hues of violet dim, one can find great glowing pools  of cyan water spanning miles. Drinking in the phosphorescent blue  glow are great black trees with reflective and shimmering green flowers, standing on stilt-like roots that presumably reach the bottom of the pools. The pools do not seem clear, but very much are, and a creature within them can see as they normally would in bright light  for about a third of the distance, as the glow does slowly overcome the silhouettes off the tree roots. That said, the pools are extremely deep, and only interrupted on the surface by the trees and buildups of detritus  between them, functioning as some semblance of ground. Great lilypads with luminescent red flowers also climb from the depths, their lancet petals giving off a  scent like melted chocolate. The flowers are edible but will give a bad stomach unless cooked (or eaten by a creature with poison resistance).  
	

==== Midnight Point ====
	Shuddering through the feywild is the peak of all darkness in an otherwise glowing realm. Wherever the midnight point passes, one can find the remnants of the **Old Courts, **Empty, Hollow shells of structures that still hold immense power. The Old Courts were buried here by the six new courts, crushed under the weight of immense magic, though the old Powers of Summer and winter still slumber, perhaps eternally, under the thick mausoleum of the machinations that placed them there. Buildings, Structures, old vaults, and occasionally roads all reveal themselves. For Six hundred rounds, one hour, the remnants are explorable, but once that time is up, the magic sinks the structures beneath some other midnight biome and anyone within the stones is lost  there in stasis until the midnight point passes again, and that can be an extremely long time.  Always in the very dead center of the midnight point is the center of magic, an important place for the court of valour, a tidal bump of ground that never seems to move but very clearly must, as it is never where it was previously. Perhaps it is the world that moves around it.
	

==== Noon Point ====
	The **Warden Of Lightning's** greatest machination is the feywild sun, through which most magic enters the feywild. A Mosaic of interference patterns ripples across the surface of the great disc. Where this portal of magic passes directly above the land, the truth of the feywild is born. All creatures under the noonpoint are capable of casting the following spells without using spell slots or requiring components
		Plant Growth
		Awaken
		Continual flame
		Control Flame
		Control Water
		Control weather
		Create Food and Water
		Create or Destroy water
		Bones of the earth
		Immovable Object
		Mending
		Nystul's Magic Aura
		Reverse gravity.
	The effects of these spells do not end as they usually would and most are simply permanent. The Magic of the noon point lasts for 600 rounds, one hour, before moving. Either the region is replaced with another noonwise biome or, if sufficiently altered, remains as it is.
	

==== Shallow Oceans ====
	Slipping along the afternoon is a child of the feydeep. Shallow Oceans are long flat sheets of salty water that are only about a foot deep at their deepest, sitting above fine tan sands. Sunrays bask among seawheat, which pokes its heavy grain out of the small surf. Exploding Glass shrimp dart along with the ebb and flow of the rippling waves, often blasting themselves into tiny shards to escape from barking barracudas. Dewy Flounders secrete fresh water that tastes like pressed rose petals when threatened, and indeed, the smell of their water is the only thing that  can ward off the Sumigi Lungfishes. One of the only things to notably break the water, the Lungfishes are huge and hungry creatures that half swim, half slither toward creatures in an attempt to eat them. Where rocks breach the sandy bottom, long tentacled anenomes reach for plankton and try to avoid Laserclams and warrior mussels. When the moon passes near, it is not uncommon for these to flood entirely as the true ocean moves in.
	

==== Ticking Forests ====
	Once a year, which is nearly always for this part of the fey, some otherwise unremarkable coniferous forests seed all at once. Along their branches, tufts of thin white and sometimes tan fibres burst forward, covering their green needles. Ticking forests are excellent sources for plant fibre but wooly beasts hide among the branches, waiting to drop down and mangle people passing by.  Cottonfir, thistlepine, Feathered spruce, and the occasional Silken Larch all crowd together in thick stands, cut only by artifical pathways. underneath the canopy is very dark, despite the brightness outside of it. Giant Jays call mockingly above anything that moves except Runeskunks, which are given exceptional berth. 


==== Dewseas ====
	Exclusively in the early morning, one can find the little cousin of the puddletops. Massive carrot-like umbels gather the mist and moisture from the night and hang on to the water so tight that one can very frequently find fish swimming around in the oversized drops, which connect from flower to flower. It is easy enough to dislodge the dew, to the despair of the things that live inside it, for the water is supported only by thin stalks. The largest of these are over 12 feet tall, while most barely crest 6. The light of the sun is enough to make the dew throw brilliant rainbow hues into the low paths carved by fey who travel through these regions. This is a good place to be careful, for Pipers are often born in dewseas, and they have a great hunger for the names of non-fey

==== Amphivalleys ====
	Sometimes, often off of stageroads, one will find the ground falls into a series of steep terraces. Deep pits gouged into the land, strangely with concentric circles leading down to a slightly raised dias. A valour fey that is ready to die is almost always present, though sometimes a young terror fey, a stressed Lore fey, or any sort of glamour fey. Ostensibly, any sort of fey will be drawn to the Amphivalley. The Crowds vary wildly in the amphivalley. Those who wish to pass through can either take the ring road, which runs around the middle of the cone, or take the middle path, which brings them to the dias. Those that go through the center are often drawn into whatever event is being shown.

==== Glittergrass Field ====
	Sweeping broadly around in the last edge of the late morning, just before noon, is one of the boldest biomes of the daylight regions. What appears to be mundane ryegrass is in fact fey Glittergrass. The seedpods of glittergrass snap into iridescence when disturbed roughly, meaning that creatures walking through the field leave a spectral wake that takes a few days to reset. Giant owls patrol the field, looking for creatures to eat. 
	

==== Girderfall ====
	It is hard to describe the true nature of a Girderfall. Not unlike Spruigia, girderfalls are extremely tall, or perhaps extremely deep regions of the feywild where Lore fey have made or perhaps grown great steel beams that cross over chasmic interruptions in the landscape. Often local fey will say that girderfalls are put in place where great catastrophes happen, but it might not be a coincidence that all of them become mines for all sorts of fey, as each seems to contain some useful material. These misty and impossibly deep mazes of metal attract their own sorts of problems, as many malevolent fey can use the steam billowing up from the depths to hide from prying eyes. Worse for the unwary traveler, these structures are always in the deep night regions, and often where stars are dim. One can see them from a ways off by the huge pillar of condensation, but that is only if moon and cloud allow. Unlike Spruigia forests, Girderfalls do not always twist their way through the feywild, and indeed, one can exit and enter at many points along the structure. 
	

==== Greenriver Cracks ====
	among hills and mountains in the late morning, as the day gets well underway, the vegetation that is so common in the feywild becomes sparse. Almost flat plateaus of smooth, dark stone make up the region. The stone is laced with fossils, mostly shells, the occasional aerial or terrestrial creature, the odd tiny humanoid. Very little can grow on this, Scraggly and thorny bushes do their best in rare clumps, as well as winding Acacia trees which seem to always have creamy lily-like blooms that smell of vanilla, but taste bitter. The fruit found among these blossoms tastes not unlike Cayenne pepper and salty cheese. Feeding on these are small herds of caribou, which sport impressive but somewhat delicate antlers made of various gemstones. The harder the gem, the more likely they are to mate for both males and females, though this means they are easier to break, depriving them of their weapons. The land is very regularly cut into chunks with somewhat deep  but very narrow canyons  between them, ones that can often be stepped over. Down in those glassy crevices, a hundred feet deep at their deepest, and maybe three feet at their most shallow, one will find small streams and creeks with clear emerald liquid, completely surrounded and on occasion choked with pungent mint. The liquid itself smells minty but also stings the eyes and mouth, and is unfortunately poisonous to most creatures, especially small disease-causing ones. White slugs with jade stripes feed on algae on the bottoms of these creeks, preyed upon by black toads and sky blue snakes. When threatened, the slugs can deploy a defense, a thick glue that is hard to get off if the creature comes in contact with the flowing green liquid.  All three of these creatures try to avoid the bright red Geladas. These roving herbivores are fierce, and eat the mint from the sides of the rivers, climbing back up to their families on the flat ground when they are finished. Their faces are transparent yellow, as if made of amber, and one can see their skulls within them, save around the eyes, which are lined with black flesh. They have air sacks on their chest that they puff up for display and communication which are striped in blue and white. The Dominant predator, aside from the odd horned tiger, are rare titanic whip scorpions, which lay flat until they spot something and then reach forward to grab it. 
	

==== Floropoli (Floropolis singular) ====
	Towering in the late morning, Gargantua flowers lift their faces to the sun and attempt to curry favour with Nectar, and indeed, favour. This place is a fiercely competitive and dangerous despite its beauty. Among flowers taller than many trees, one can find Greater and Shimmerwooled Rumblebees (//Megabombus Titanicus// and //Incidentus), //looking for pollen. Sprites and pixies often work here, as it is the easiest way to get favour above one's stature, but they are preyed upon by everything from displacer beasts to dragons. On occasion, one might find that some of the flowers are quite talkative, especially as they convince creatures to move their pollen around. Some of them are so insistent on spreading their pollen that they die shortly after it is done, having spent all their favour. 

==== Ancient bedlands ====
	Set where the solid yellow sunlight of the afternoon just barely tips toward evening, walls of Marrowbark spruce sit on the thinnest topsoil among barren highlands. Among these trees, poking through downy moss or out of solid bare rock, are massive bones, the relics of titans from ages gone past. Dinosaur, Dragon, Demon, Devil, Giant, Titans, and various monstrosities all coalesce here. Bonechitterings, small gangly human shaped creatures with a mane of hair but no face nest among skull and ribs, leery of travellers but not dangerous until aggravated. Stone colossi sit silent and waiting among these lands, incapable of communicating, indifferent, but very much aware, Occasionally they attack each other, particularly ones of similar make. The bones from these bedlands make excellent material in the creation of phylacteries, though fickle. If they're damaged enough, they return to the place they came from with incredible magical force. 

==== **Corona Mesas** ====
	Past the twilight hours, after dark is properly established, one might find Corona Mesas. A relatively dry and sandy landscape, the Corona Mesas host some very vibrant life. Cacti (and Cacti adjacent), Succulent, and desert plants of all sorts glow in their own special patterns and colours. Red Ribbed Saguaros, Aloe with dim cyan taproots, Agave with bright light green flowers. But the luminous stars of the show, far outshining the yet dim stars, are the Mesas. At least one band of the towering stone buttes and plateaus glows a cool orange. 

==== Wanderswamp ====
	Early in the gloaming hours of the evening, there are swamps which have a vile trick to play. Wanderswamps are marked by their knee-deep waters that are sharply demarcated by thick reeds and plants. The beds of the rivers that flow through these swamps are firm and sandy and have no plants growing from them. All of the plants are extremely hostile to anything that touches them,entangling anything that walks on them, slowly dragging them down into the mulchy earth they've made. Will-o-wisps and marsh candles made from the decaying dead often mislead unwary travellers. 

==== Evermountain ====


==== Lushlava Fields ====
	Around the noon hours, when the sun has just begun its descent, cracks in the land may spew forth with raw fey magic


Half normal pond but fairy and corals

==== Immense Sky ====
	The sky feels bigger, larger, and heavier. Wis save to not be exhausted
	

==== Defacing* ====
	Entering this zone is like entering a kind of.. fuzzy crosshatch vision. Everything desaturates and becomes just a little sharply fuzzed at the edges, but faces smear in long trails (of both people and animals). Identity fluid here, and one might find oneself in the company of more than one initially suspects.

==== **Foefog** * ====
	A creation of a dark night-time mist descending upon the feywilds, a time when the fleeting shadows in your periphery wake to become temporarily just a little too real, creeping up to stand in the corners of your room, hiding in the piles of clothes and among the books, and even curled at the end of your sleeping bag.
	

==== Deepstorm* ====
	Tentacles from the sky in storm vortexes like an upside down ocean. Sometimes fish drop out of the sky.

==== Seafog ====
	Along coastal locations, particularly rocky ones, folk may find the air suddenly very thick and hard to breathe as fog rolls in. What were rocks may open to be anenomes or barnacles, and coming in with the fog may be many fantastical skyfish. A decent athletics check will allow a person to fly, but be warned, the fog can roll out quickly.
