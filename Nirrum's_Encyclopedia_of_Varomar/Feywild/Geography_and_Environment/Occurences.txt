Puppetplays: A mostly normal forest segment, but unusually dark, where the trees are bare except for thin black strings that hang from hand-like branches. If approached or touched, they will attempt to attach, seeking out travellers and animals alike, and if caught, wrap around their limbs to make them dance to an invisible script.

Rattlinhole: On occasion, the ground isn't properly formed, and a person can fall into a dark watery abyss, disappearing below the ground. Areas with rattlinholes are entirely unsafe to walk on. The best way to get out of a rattlinhole in a way that doesn't endanger people is to swim down and find the rattlintree, On the tree there are thick limbs, sporting wild branches with wiry twigs, on one of these twigs there is always a nest, occupied by a single bird, within whom is an egg, nearly ready to hatch, though the egg is already infested with a parasitic mage-tick, which is kept immortal by an ethereal louse. Any magical damage to the mother bird kills the louse, which causes the tick to suffocate, saving the hatchling, who holds the magic of the tree, allowing it to sprout through the hole one fell through, sealing the rattlinhole behind it
