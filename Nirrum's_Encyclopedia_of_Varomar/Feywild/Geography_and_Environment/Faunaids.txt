Forzeta - a goat-like creature that moves extremely quickly

Hooglie - a horse's head, a goat's eyes and horns, and the body of a rather large chicken. Used as mounts. Slightly more cunning than a stale cake.

Dandelion Pastures: lush yellow fields prowled by plant-like beasts with manes of yellow or white. The milk from these creatures tastes deliciously irresistable to creatures of extraplanar/non-prime material creatures (fae, tieflings, genasi, aasimar and such) but vile and bitter to everybody else. The creatures are hermaphrodites, despite their mild similarity to real lions.
