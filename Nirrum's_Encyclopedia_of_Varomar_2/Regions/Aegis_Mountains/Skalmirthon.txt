===== Description =====
	Burrowed into the heart of the northwestern Aegis is the great dwarven city of Skalmirthon. The culture of these people echoes in every rock, in each block, in every step that can be taken. The dwarves work for each other, gain for each other, and care for each other, or else. A single dwarf in anger is always a problem, and it is never one those in power can afford. The dwarves in these mountains come with a guarantee. We //will// thrive. Time and time again, they have proven themselves to be the most siegeproof, corruption resistant, and dedicated civilization on the plane, which makes their partnership with the dark elves all the less likely. Stripped from their homes, many of them fell away from the influence of their god, whose presence was prevented from taking hold on this plane. Nearly an entire race of fantatics, now floating without the constant assurance that their god was watching them, now not only without that god, but exposed to the power of other gods who would far rather influence them to chill out. The drow of Skalmirthon are listless but still excellent hunters and warriors and in many ways, old habits die hard. With the blessing (and influence) of new gods, the alien drow are under control but blades are still sharp when sheathed. 
	


==== Urban ====
	Skalmirthon is made of stone row housing, some of it carved out of the original stone that stood before the mountain was hollowed out, some that is seamless, unmortared stone in perfect joinery, some that is perhaps more mortar than stone. Each house holds enough room for staircases to the floor above and the room for a dwarven family to sleep and store their personal belongings. Pressurised water is ubiquitous in Skalmirthon, drawn from ever replenishing snowmelt on the aegis and carried out into the valleys along with the surplus. Pipes run above the buildings where they can, falling downward into each building, supported by all manner of framing, wire, chain, beams and pillars. But row houses aren't all that exist in skalmirthon. After the influx of Manarahi and Konian Refugees in the last century, houses have been built around the suppports for the roof of the mountain, and a few who preferred the cold and the thin air have set up on the peak, using long stairs or lifts to get down to the ground. Buildings built into the cieling appear as stars in the sky or the nests of Daubers. Both dwarven magic and incredible craftsdwarfship prevent the mountain from falling. 

== Districts ==
	Skalmirthon is divided into districts that are very distinctly separated. This does mean that living quarters can be very far away from job sites, but folk manage the Journey well enough

	**1) Throne of the King**
		This lone tower sits in the centre of the volcano, and it is the formal home of the king of Manaharamu. It is six floors tall and extremely ornate within, with the throne itself being on the second last floor. It sits directly beneath the open crater, though recently work has been done to make the throne airship resistant. 
		Around the base of the tower
		For 50 years after the previous king died, there was no one on the throne of Skalmirthon, until an adventurer from Manaharamu was selected by clandestine forces within the city to take the fall for their corruption. Unfortunately for them, King Deloch Welch was a surprisingly capable king. He rather swiftly undid the sources of corruption in the town, using local experts and a rather large amount of alchemical ingredients.
