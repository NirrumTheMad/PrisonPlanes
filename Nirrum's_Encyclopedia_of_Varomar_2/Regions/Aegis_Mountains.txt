====== Aegis Mountains ======
Created Monday 23 October 2023

A wide and soaring volcanic Mountain range, made as magma seeped out of the crust through the cracks made by the descent of the great demon orcus. Most of the aegis range is fairly rapidly cooled extrusive igneous, mostly Rhyolite with some stranger inclusions. The aegis mountains are both the largest and longest mountain range on snarl and has a huge impact on the climate of the rest of the plane. The aegis' effects reach down into the magma sea upon which they sit, compressing the once massive chamber of magically heated rock, one of the mechanisms of the prison. They thrust up through the underground sea and entirely engulf the original strata around them, their tumultuos births oscillated between rapid and slow, building a wide range of peaks, while coating the entire plane in a layer of glassy ash. 

The aegis carries magic in its deep roots as well as passages into the depths of the world, carved out by forces alien to its inception. No matter what culture you are in this world, the aegis plays a part in your life, either by how it shapes the weather, or by how it shapes the skyline.


In the heart of the Western Aegis range lies the Skal volcano, one of the last volcanic hotspots on the plane, and of course, within the incredibly inhospitable, wide, and treacherous mountain range, the lelumadil dwarves made their home.
